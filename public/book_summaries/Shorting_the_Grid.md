How the grid works
Electricity produced = electricity used at all times 
Electricity is made and used simultaneously 
The balancing authority has responsibility for calling plants online & asking plants to leave the grid in order to maintain balance 

Utility provision is split between: RTOs and vertically integrated utilities (one firm responsible for generation and distribution)  

Transmission systems follow the power plants & closing power plants with the intention of building a distributed generation increases the costs of transmission
Since most renewables are intermittent they need to be backed up with something 

The Balancing Authority 
All grids have a balancing authority (BA). The BA is part of a bigger multi-state organisation such as the New England Grid Operator (ISO-NE)
Different technologies have different abilities
steam-fired power plants can vary their power output but the rate of change of power output is relatively slow 
Internal combustion power plants can ramp up & down very quickly
Even internal combustion plants aren’t instant. So the grid has ancillary services, which consists of paying plants to be on hot standby, with spinning turbines but no load read to send power to the grid very fast when called on.  

With renewables given their dependence on real-time conditions, the BA cannot order them online to match requirements, but they can ask them to go offline (“curtailing” 

People look at solar as a distributed system, but it is more accurately described as a single megaplant which switches off early in the evening. 

Vertically integrated or RTO 
Understanding how power is paid for is a black box in areas of the country designated Regional Transmission Organisations (RTOs) areas. 
Before 1999 there were only vertically-integrated utility owned power plants & distribution equipment. The utility had the responsibility of keeping the lights on and would be fined for unreliability. The utility got paid a rate-of-return on its expenditures, which generated the incentive to increase expenditures. This lead to very high reliability, but had the perverse incentive of excess redundancy and too much spending. 

RTOs Replace the Integrated Utiltiies 
In an RTO area there are three types of utilities
Generation Utilities: Merchant Generators that generate the power 
Distribution Utilities: own the distribution systems for the power 
Other types of Load Serving Entities.
