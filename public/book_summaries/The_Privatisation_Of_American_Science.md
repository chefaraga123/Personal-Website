The restructuring of the corporate form and the outsourcing of commercial R&D
In the 1980s there was a significant decrease in firms’ propensity to divest
Networks of contractors began to displace ownership ties as modes of organisation
Labour intensive heavy manufacturing was increasing outsourced to low-wage countries
percevied shift towards market coordination (away from managerial hierarchical coordination)

Starting in the early 20th century, a large proportion of all PhDs were employed in research divisions
within large corporations. The breakdown of the Chandlerian model of hierarchical integration prompted the
divestment of R&D
Why integrate R&D if it can be done externally, however this assumes that R&D is a distinct fungible
commodity part of a well-developed market

The range of rsearch involved in offshore outsourcing is significant:
- investment banks export work in finanical analysis
- radiologists in India interpret Americans’ CT scans
- Intel’s China Software Lab in Shanghai
etc…

Significant transformation of the American science base: offshore outsourcing is the bulk
of privatised research

Many of the nascent institutions of globalised privatised research were first pioneered outside
of the academic sector as adjuncts to the changes to the modern corporation

The Withdrawal of the state from its role as science patron and manager
The percentage of national R&D expenditure provided by US federal government has been falling
since roughly 1967, while that coming from private industry has been rising since roughly 1967.

There has been a slow unwinding of the Military <> Academic complex, a phenomena receiving
the most attention in the Bayh-Dole Act (1980)
This permitted universities and small business to own patents on discoveries made with
government R&D funding.
However it was only one part of a series of legislation devoted to extricating the government
from cold war science management

Retreat from the premise that the state should be the primary provider of education for its populace
re-engineering of universities into competitive global service industries. Universities are being
framed as producing “information” and “human capital”
Much of the accounting structure of universities is oriented around the legal presumption of their
non-profit status
Students grants were converted to student loans to hasten the redefinition of the student as consumer
The ultimate objective of US education policy is two pronged:
- to preserve a few private legacy institutions and
- convert most of the rest of the educational system to low-cost for-profit options

public/private identities are blurred

Wherever research is to be conducted it will only be supported under conditions of commercialised joint
ventures with external corporations

information shades impercetibly into infotainment

The marketplace of ideas as core neoliberal doctrine
individual trends:
- knowledge economy
- spread of the internet
- the strenghening of IP
- Corporate outsourcing of R&D
- Withdrawal of state proided education
“reification of the ideal economy as a marketplace of ideas”
Information didn’t play a significant role in economic theory until post-war period
The transformation of the market from a simple allocation device for material goods to the ultimate in information processing.

The ontological status of information vs knowledge
The market was framed as a super computer

Hayek is regarded as the godfather of the rise of the neoliberal movement in social thought
and behind the establishment of the Chicago school of economics
“connectionist theory of mind”

Neoliberalism diverged from classical political liberalism in a number of ways, it renounced the passive notion of a laissez faire economy in favour of an activist and constructionist approach to the spread and promotion of free markets. The starting point of neoliberalism is the admission, contrary to classical liberalism, that its political program will only triumph if it becomes reconciled to the fact that the conditions
for its success must be constructed and won’t emerge naturally.
Neoliberals didn’t believe the market could be relied upon to perpetuate its own existence
The economic problem of society is not merely a problem of how to allocate given resources, it
is rather a problem of the integration of knowledge which is not given to anyone in totality
This revision of the perennial economic problem was the embryo for neoliberalism

“Freedom is not the realisation of any telos, but rather the positing of autonomous self-governed
individuals all naaturally equipped with a neoclassical version of rationality and motives
of self-interest”
“The nation state such be subject to discipline and limitation through international
initiatives. Implemented by neoliberal takeover of the IMF, WTO, World Bank etc..”
“Redefinition of property rights is a key way through which the state exerts neoliberal domination”
“Freedom is redefined to mean only one narrow version of economic freedom within the new reconceptualisation of the market, controls over human action were to be reconfigured into a new version of competitive order.
Chicago neoliberalism transcends the classical liberal tension between the self-interested agent
and the patriotic duty of the citizen by reducing both state and market to the flat ontology of
the neoclassical economic model
“no such thing as society” as outside of the market
the web embodies the neoliberal belief in the wisdom of crowds
“the networked environment unlocks a new modality for organising production, radically decentred,
collaborative and non-proprietary”

The neoliberal sought to make the inside of the firm work like a virtual market
One of the most important aspects of the marketisation of the corporation was to treat
knowledge as not the special possession of the employees of the firm or as an inherent
capacity of a social unit borne of shared experience but rather to acquiese to the power
of the market

Neoliberal prescribes the creation of a market

A fundamental premise of the book is to decouple most functions of scientific research from
the education functions to which they had been wedded during most of the 20th century
“The logic of the public good rationale is precisely that of the Bayh-Dole Act”

Things that Economists say about Science
The Linear Model
- Federal money
-> Basic Research -> Applied Research -> Development -> Technology -> Application
-> Social Benefits
The real consequence of the demise of the linear model has been to question the notion
that science directly causes economic growth
It was stipulated that there were several distinct classes of science basic/applied/development
which putatively served as inputs to their descendants
Most modern commentators on science policy tend to skip over Bernal, Polanyi and Hayek
instead attributing its origins to Vannevar Bush
“The marginalist revolution” — Walras
“the law of one price” — all generic goods in a market must trade at the same price in equilibrium
traded goods are regarded as equivalents in equilibrium

“Darvinian natural selection has repeatedly been reconsidered at the level of the fundamental
organising metapho”

The sciences were never at war?
The neoclassical theory of the maximisation of utility was derived directly from the immediately
preceding innovations in physics in the 1840s — 1860s

Mirowski discusses the bowdlerisation of the theory of energy, where bowdlerisation refers to the practices of simplifying or censoring a work. The progenitors of neoclassicism copied down the physics equations and changed the names of the variables

Irving Fisher describes how energy in physics corresponds to utility in economics
The perennial complaint that neoclassical theory is static and not dynamic

The neoclassical statement that in a closed cycle the initial and final states of a system are independent of path, in mechanics, this is isomorphic to a statement of the conservation of energy”

The analogy, strictly and logically interpreted, would suggest the ontological equivalence of money and utility

One of the main attractions of analogic reasoning is that it provides a shortcut in the exploration of the implications and structures of a given explanatory configuration because those implications and structures have undergone appreciable development elsewhere. Some parts of metaphors
are not freely disposable

The epistemological necessity of conservation principles in field theories is mirrored in their mathematics.

Macroeconomic instability and the natural processes in early neoclassical economics
Jevons’ sunspot and the pitfalls of inductive argument
direct analogy between economic transactions and transfers of energy

The linear model as a model for describing the production of science was forged without
any empirical enquity into the relevant histories of science and technology

The linear model held forth that that nonmarket, nonaccountable activities could be
cogently tamed through cost/benefit analysis through backward imputation from the empirically
observed fina; value of the goods to the virtual value attributed to noneconomic activities that
had initially set them in motion. 1

Subtle epistemological gradations between science and technology were out, “technoscience” was in

The specific notion of the public good was first formalised by Paul Samuelson in 1954,
the existence of “nonrivalrous” goods soon became conflated with externalities.
In welfare economics, the generic problem of externalities was reframed as a problem of non-exclusion
