# Innovations in Mining 
Mining
Down to modern times, mining remained technically very crude: the pick and the hammer were its principal tools. The derivatives of mining developed with increasing sophistication: smelting, refining, smithing, casting all increasing the speed of production.

Lathe
The most important instrument of precision in the transmission of motion and the shaping of materials came from the lathe.

Neothilic innovation
Order and security was the key improvement. Out of stability grew a cooperative social and economic life. In certain kinds of goods trade over wide areas emerged very early (amber, obsidian, flint and salt).

The transmission of craft-knowledge tended to create occupational castes. The elements of a civilisation are never in complete equilibrium, but a dynamic difference in pressure between life-destroying and life-conserving functions

Mining & Capitalism
Mining was undertaken by free men. In 14th century Germany the working of the mine was done as a simple partnership on a share basis. There was a rapid improvement in technique in German mines, and by the 16th century German miners were being imported into other countries to improve performance. (ARTICLE IDEA: early modern consultancy!)

The deepening of the mines, more generally their increased scale necessitated new innovations such as complicated machinery for pumping water, hauling ore or ventilating the mine, this necessitated a large amount of capital than the original workers possessed. This lead to absentee ownership, and ultimately the loss of worker control and hence the reduction of economic upside from profit share to wages. There was speculation in mining shares as early as the 16th century!

German Peasants’ War (~1525) was the biggest uprising before the French Revolution.

Mining and Warfare
Improvements in the techniques of warfare, especially the rapid growth of artillery lead to an increase in the consumption of iron and lead to new demands on the mine.

There was a mutually reinforcing nexus of war, mechanisation, mining and finance.

Value is derived from life-function not scarcity.

On the value of wood
Wood has both the qualities of stone and metal: stronger in cross-section than stone, wood resembles steel in its physical properties with its relatively high tensile and compressive strength and elastic nature. Wood is only matched by metals following an impressive line of metallurgical skill.

Power of the woodsman almost synonymous with power production and industrialisation. The shoring that makes possible the deep tunnel of the mine!

The barrel with the use of compression and tension to achieve water tightness is ingenious! A great advance in strength and lightness over clay containers.

Foot-treadle gave Watt the inspiration for converting reciprocating motion into rotary motion in the steam engine!

Warfare and machine
The musketeer is a mechanically responsive infrantryman. All the arms of service have been progressively coordinated with the most deadly and decisive arm: the artillery (makes me think of war in the age of intelligent machines!). Artillery is the systematic embodiment of cannon and mechanical clock.

The regimentation of modern warfare has a wider reaching influence than the army itself. If instead of mechanical obedience communication along the command structure was met with activity communication would likely be obstructed.



# The Eotechnic Phase
Mumford argues that each of the phases of human technological progress can be characterised by the form of some technological mesh.

The period is characterised by its form of energy, and the predominant materials used, particular fairly universal constraints flow from these characteristics. For the eotechnic phase, these are water and wood.

If power machinery was a criterion for an industrial revolution Mumford argues the revolution would have started in the 12th century and be in full swing by the 15th.

The invention of utilities for the horse served to increase actual horsepowers, such as the horseshoe and the horse harness

Waterwheels were invented as early as the 3rd century BC, however it wasn’t until the 14th century AD they were ubiquitous in Europe. As early as the 15th-century water mills were used for crushing ore.

Fourneyron’s water-turbine was an improvement over traditional waterwheels, allowing for a more efficient conversion of kinetic energy into mechanical energy. It laid the foundation for modern hydropower technology. Played a crucial role in the evolution of mechanical power transmission.

There were many inventions during this phase that improved the art of navigation. The 12th century saw the introduction of the mariner’s compass, the 13th the installation of the permanent rudder (used instead of oars for steering), and the 16th the use of the clock to determine latitude (by improving the accuracy of celestial navigation).

From the 16th century on canals supplemented the natural waterways. Canal mania gripped Britain in the late 18th and early 19th century, when a large number of canal construction projects were proposed and built in response to the need for an efficient transportation system prompted by the industrial revolution. It’s a mania due to the deployment of capital into many projects that didn’t become economically viable.

Glass is a very ancient invention, which didn’t turn properly come back into Europe until the middle ages. The invention of glass changes the dynamic of indoor life, lengthening the days.

With the growth of capitalism came the bestowing of special monopolies, first to chartered companies and then to the owners of patents. The invention of the experimental method in science. This method was a labour saving device insofar that it permitted the organisation of experience in terms of mechanical causality and the development of controlled, repeatable and verifiable experiments.

By the end of the 17th century time-keeping and combined with record-keeping to produce the newsletter, the market report, the periodical etc…


# The Paleotechnic Phase

The era that is commonly understood by the first industrial revolution of England from the 18th through the 19th century

As noted previously, each phase is characterised by certain dominant forms of power, materials and social objectives.

Considering the previous in this series, the Eotechnic phase, this phase is characterized by coal and iron and the increasing subjugation of man to the machine. Whilst mining did take place in the previous phase, it would not be characterised as a mining civilisation.

Whilst charcoal had been used during the Eotechnic phase, the

Prior to the invention of the high-powered blast furnace iron production was slow and labour intensive, this invention enabled the production of high quality steel in large quantities.

Watt’s steam engine was a big improvement over the Newcomen steam engine. Watt’s engine powered pumps that could remove water from coal and iron ore mines, critical to the development of the industry.
