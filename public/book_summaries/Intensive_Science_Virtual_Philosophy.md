## Note
I have read this book very slowly, over a very long period of time, as each page takes me a while to internalise and intuit. I still haven't finished it! but i'll add to this over the coming weeks hopefully. 

## Chapter 1: The Mathematics of the virtual
### Manifolds
Deleuze introduces the concept of a multiplicity as an answer to the much older philosophical concept of the essence. 
The essence of a thing being that which explains its identity. Those fundamental traits without which an object would not be what it is. 

Within a Deleuzian ontology a species (or any natural kind) is defined by the morphogenetic process that gave rise to it rather than some timeless essence. 

Species are not timeless entities, they are historically constituted. Shared resemblances are explained by common processes of selection. Essentialist understandings of the world, whereas a morphogenetic account is inherently dynamic.

Timeless categories need to be replaced by historical processes. 

Multiplicities solve the circular issue of shifting the essence from the object to the process. Multiplicites specify the structure of spaces of possibilities. A multiplicity is closely related to a **manifold** - a term which designatres a geometrical spaces with certain properties.

Descartes & Fermat invented the familiar method of embedding curves into a two dimensional space on which arbitrary axes could be fixed. Once embedded, the fixed axes allow for the assignment of a pair of numbers (coordinates) to every point on the curve - so that geometric relations between points could be expressed. 

The term manifold belongs to the **differential geometry** of Gauss & Riemann. This idea relied on differential & integral calculus. Calculus is used to solve problems involving relations between the changes of >2 quantities. If these relations were expressed as the relative rate of change of quantity vs others, calculus enables us to find the instantaneous value of one of the rates. This lead to the realisation that a geometrical object could be characterised by the rate at which its curvature changed at different points. 

Gauss realised that calculus allowed the study of the surface without any reference to a global embedding space. Gauss developed a method to implant the coordinate axes on the surface itself & to use differential equations to characterise their relations. 

A Deleuzian multiplicity takes as its first defining feature these two traits of a manifold: its variable number of dimensions and the asbence of a higher dimension imposing extrinsic coordinatisation. 

essences are taken to exist in a transcendent space serving as a contained for them or in which they are embedded. To replace essences with multiplicities we need to elucidate a deeper ontological difference and specify the way in which multiplicities relate to the philosophical processes that generate material objects & kinds. 

To establish the multiplicity properly we need to intimately relate the geometric properties of manifolds and the properties that define **morphogenetic processes**. Here we look to **dynamical systems theory** in which the dimensions of a manifold represent properties of a particular physical process or system. The manifold becomes the space of possible states the physical system can take. When modelling the dynamical behaviour of a physical system we seek first to identify the system's degrees of freedom and henceforth mapping each degree of freedom onto one of the dimensions of the manifold. 

Any given point in this state space captures the state of the corresponding object at a particular point in time. An object's instantaneous state, no matter its complexity, becomes a single point. Complex dynamical processes are modelled as trajectories in an abstract space of possible states. 

Poincare discovered and classified special topological features of 2-D manifolds (called **singularities**) which have a large influence in the behaviour of the trajectories. Singularities may influence behaviour by acting as **attractors for the trajectories**. Given different initial conditions a system may converge in the same final state - hence singularities are understood as the intrinsic long-term tendencies of a system, also known as a **steady-state**. Poincare also identified certain clossed loops acting as attractors calling them **limit cycles**. These are recurrent topological features. Different sets of equations, representing different physical system may possess a similar distribution of attractors & hence similar long-term behaviour. 

There are a large number of physical structures which form spontaneously as their components try to meet energetic requirements. 

Singularities, by determining long-term tendencies, structure the possibilities which make up state space, and hence structure the possibilitiees open to the physical process modelled by a state space. Singularities tend to characterise processes independent of their physical instantiation. This **mechanism-independence** is what makes singularities a candidate to replace essences. Singularities need to be understood as ontologically distinct from a process. 

### Group Theory 
The term **group** refers to a set of entities with particular properties and a rule of combination of those entities. The most important of these properties being **closure** which means that the combination rule of any two entities in the set yields an entity also belonging to the set. Think integers with addition as the combination rule. 

For the purpose of defining **progressive differentiation** we need to consider groups not as objects but as transformations e.g. the set consisting of rotations by 0, 90, 180, 270 degrees with an additive combination rule. Groups of transformations can be used to classify geometric structures by thei **invariant properties**. Figures are classified by their responses to transformations. We can now conceptualise how entities can be converted to another entity by a process through which their invariants change e.g. a sphere can become a cube by loosing invariance to some transformations. 

In a physical process, transmutations through broken symmetry make occur in the form of phase transitions. Phase transitions are events which take place at some critical parameter e.g. temperature which may switch a physical system from one state to another. 

A singularity may undergod a symmetry-breaking transition and be converted into another one. These transitions are called bifurcations and may be studied by adding control parameters to a particular state space. A state space with one point attractor may bifurcate into another one with two such attractors, or a point attractor may bifurcate into a periodic one, bifurcations can defined **recurrent sequences** of such forms. A symmetry breaking cascade can be related to actual recurring sequences in physical processes. It is the univerality (or mechanism-independence) of multiplicities which denotes its significance. (are essences necessarily only understood with respect to some particular physical embedding?). Essences are abstract & general entities, multiplicites are concrete universals. Multiplicites give rise to essences. 

Entities are abstract general entities that coexist, sharply distinguished from one another, concrete universals are instead meshed together into a continuum.
