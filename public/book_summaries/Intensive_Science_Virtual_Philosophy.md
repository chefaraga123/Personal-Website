## Note
I have read this book very slowly, over a very long period of time, as each page takes me a while to internalise and intuit. I still haven't finished it! but i'll add to this over the coming weeks hopefully. 

## Chapter 1: The Mathematics of the virtual
### Manifolds
Deleuze introduces the concept of a multiplicity as an answer to the much older philosophical concept of the essence. 
The essence of a thing being that which explains its identity. Those fundamental traits without which an object would not be what it is. 

Within a Deleuzian ontology a species (or any natural kind) is defined by the morphogenetic process that gave rise to it rather than some timeless essence. 

Species are not timeless entities, they are historically constituted. Shared resemblances are explained by common processes of selection. Essentialist understandings of the world, whereas a morphogenetic account is inherently dynamic.

Timeless categories need to be replaced by historical processes. 

Multiplicities solve the circular issue of shifting the essence from the object to the process. Multiplicites specify the structure of spaces of possibilities. A multiplicity is closely related to a **manifold** - a term which designatres a geometrical spaces with certain properties.

Descartes & Fermat invented the familiar method of embedding curves into a two dimensional space on which arbitrary axes could be fixed. Once embedded, the fixed axes allow for the assignment of a pair of numbers (coordinates) to every point on the curve - so that geometric relations between points could be expressed. 

The term manifold belongs to the **differential geometry** of Gauss & Riemann. This idea relied on differential & integral calculus. Calculus is used to solve problems involving relations between the changes of >2 quantities. If these relations were expressed as the relative rate of change of quantity vs others, calculus enables us to find the instantaneous value of one of the rates. This lead to the realisation that a geometrical object could be characterised by the rate at which its curvature changed at different points. 

Gauss realised that calculus allowed the study of the surface without any reference to a global embedding space. Gauss developed a method to implant the coordinate axes on the surface itself & to use differential equations to characterise their relations. 

A Deleuzian multiplicity takes as its first defining feature these two traits of a manifold: its variable number of dimensions and the asbence of a higher dimension imposing extrinsic coordinatisation. 

essences are taken to exist in a transcendent space serving as a contained for them or in which they are embedded. To replace essences with multiplicities we need to elucidate a deeper ontological difference and specify the way in which multiplicities relate to the philosophical processes that generate material objects & kinds. 

To establish the multiplicity properly we need to intimately relate the geometric properties of manifolds and the properties that define **morphogenetic processes**. Here we look to **dynamical systems theory** in which the dimensions of a manifold represent properties of a particular physical process or system. The manifold becomes the space of possible states the physical system can take. When modelling the dynamical behaviour of a physical system we seek first to identify the system's degrees of freedom and henceforth mapping each degree of freedom onto one of the dimensions of the manifold. 

Any given point in this state space captures the state of the corresponding object at a particular point in time. An object's instantaneous state, no matter its complexity, becomes a single point. Complex dynamical processes are modelled as trajectories in an abstract space of possible states. 

Poincare discovered and classified special topological features of 2-D manifolds (called **singularities**) which have a large influence in the behaviour of the trajectories. Singularities may influence behaviour by acting as **attractors for the trajectories**. Given different initial conditions a system may converge in the same final state - hence singularities are understood as the intrinsic long-term tendencies of a system, also known as a **steady-state**. Poincare also identified certain clossed loops acting as attractors calling them **limit cycles**. These are recurrent topological features. Different sets of equations, representing different physical system may possess a similar distribution of attractors & hence similar long-term behaviour. 

There are a large number of physical structures which form spontaneously as their components try to meet energetic requirements. 

Singularities, by determining long-term tendencies, structure the possibilities which make up state space, and hence structure the possibilitiees open to the physical process modelled by a state space. Singularities tend to characterise processes independent of their physical instantiation. This **mechanism-independence** is what makes singularities a candidate to replace essences. Singularities need to be understood as ontologically distinct from a process. 

### Group Theory 
The term **group** refers to a set of entities with particular properties and a rule of combination of those entities. The most important of these properties being **closure** which means that the combination rule of any two entities in the set yields an entity also belonging to the set. Think integers with addition as the combination rule. 

For the purpose of defining **progressive differentiation** we need to consider groups not as objects but as transformations e.g. the set consisting of rotations by 0, 90, 180, 270 degrees with an additive combination rule. Groups of transformations can be used to classify geometric structures by thei **invariant properties**. Figures are classified by their responses to transformations. We can now conceptualise how entities can be converted to another entity by a process through which their invariants change e.g. a sphere can become a cube by loosing invariance to some transformations. 

In a physical process, transmutations through broken symmetry make occur in the form of phase transitions. Phase transitions are events which take place at some critical parameter e.g. temperature which may switch a physical system from one state to another. 

A singularity may undergod a symmetry-breaking transition and be converted into another one. These transitions are called bifurcations and may be studied by adding control parameters to a particular state space. A state space with one point attractor may bifurcate into another one with two such attractors, or a point attractor may bifurcate into a periodic one, bifurcations can defined **recurrent sequences** of such forms. A symmetry breaking cascade can be related to actual recurring sequences in physical processes. It is the univerality (or mechanism-independence) of multiplicities which denotes its significance. (are essences necessarily only understood with respect to some particular physical embedding?). Essences are abstract & general entities, multiplicites are concrete universals. Multiplicites give rise to essences. 

Entities are abstract general entities that coexist, sharply distinguished from one another, concrete universals are instead meshed together into a continuum. 

**In what sense can a continuous space progressively give rise to discontinuous spaces**. A space is not just a set of points, but a set together with a way of binding these points together into neighbourhoods through well-defined relations of proximity or contiguity. Within out familiar **Eucliedean geomtry** these relations are specified by fixed lengths or distances which determine points' closeness. The concept of length (as well as area, volume) are known as a **metric concept**, and spaces of Euclidean geometry are known as **metric spaces**. There exist other types of spaces where distances don't define proximities as distances don't remained fixed. A topological space may be stretched without the neighbourhoods which define it changing in nature. 

There are well-defined technical ways of linking metric & non-metric spaces in such a way tha tthe form becomes the product of the progressive differentiation opf the latter. 
**To understand this properly we need to discuss the history of geometry.**

In the 19th century the prevailing conception of the structure of space was captured by Euclidean geometry, there were however, geometries for which metric concepts were not fundamental. E.g. Gauss & Riemann's differential geometry
which furnished us the concept of the manifold, as well as several others: projective geometry, affine geometry, topology. What was discovered was that basic concepts of Euclidean geometry could be derived from non-metric concepts!
Felix Klein realised that all known geometries could be categorised by their invariants under different groups of transformations. Some of these geometries, projective - affine - Euclidean, could be seen as forming levels of a hierarchy. 
In Euclidean geometry two triangles are equivalent only if their sides are the same length, in affine geometry *all triangles are the same*. Topology can be understood as the least differentiated geometry. This geometric hierarchy could be 
understood as an abstract scenario for the birth of real space.

**Extensive/Intensive Properties & Metrics/Non-Metric Space**
**Extensive properties** include not only those metric properties such as length/area/volume, but also quantities like energy/entropy - they are defined as intrinsically divisible properties. 
**Intensive properties** are those that cannot be divided, such as temperature or pressure, with a change in kind i.e. a qualitative change in the system. 

Metric space emerges from a nonmetric continuum through a cascade of broken symmetries, undifferentiated intensive spaces gives rise to extensive strucutres (discontinuous structures with metric properties).

Modal logic is the branch of philosophy that deals with the relations between the possible and the actual. 


Despite their lack of actuality **attractors** are real and have definite effects on actual entities, they confer on trajectories a certain degree of stability called **asymptotic stability**.
Small shocks may dislodge a trajectory from its attractor, whilst the shock is not too large to push it out of its basin of attraction the trajectory will return to the stable state defined by the attractors

The virtual is not opposed to the real, but to the actual. 

Traditionally ontological discussion of *possibilities* has been stunted due to their elusive nature & the difficulty of providing a clear criterion for individuating them, 



## The Actualisation of the virtual in space 

The picture of a continuous topological space undergoing discontinuous transitions is a powerful metaphor for the cosmic genesis of spatial structure. 

Core concepts that characterise intensive thinking: populations and rates of change. 

The process of the individuation of species 

Up until Darwin, biological entities were seen as eternal archetypes defined by a transcendental essence. Darwn depicted the historically contingent nature of species. 

Biologist Michael Ghiselin argues that a species formed through the double process of *natural selection* and *reproductive isolation* does not represent a higher ontological category than the 

individual organisms that compose it. Unlike the relation between a natural kind & its members - which is one of instantiation, the relation of individual species to individual organisms is one of wholes and parts - much as 
the relation of the organism and the cells that compose it. 
Unlike the relations between a particular instance and a general type the relaiton between parts and wholes is causal. 
Relations between general types and individual instances is hierarchical, each level representing a different ontological category, an approach in terms of interacting parts and emergent wholes leads to a flat ontology. 

A way in which physicists state the distinction between the intensive and the extensive 

**Externsive properties** add up in a simple way: two areas sum to a proportionally larger area
**Intensive properties** do not add up - but rather average. 

A particular value of temperature or pressure, being an average, will remain the same when the body possessing these properties is broken into n parts. 

Differences in thermodynamic intensities are capable of driving a process of equilibriation in a population of molecures, a process in which these differences will tend to average themselves out.

A linear system with a single attractor: while the system is moving towards the attractor state, this unactualised end state already exists, actively attracting the process towards itself. In this case the *virtuality* is easy to grap. Once the process is over it is easy to overlook this virtuality. 

The earlier description of multiplicities left unresolved the question of their nature as concrete universal eentities. We used features of certain mathemtical models as a source for the notions that define a multiplicity.
