Preface
This book has taught me more about neoliberalism, and liberalism, than anything else I have ever read whilst not being a book intended to discuss the nature of or propagandistically espouse the virture of those ideologies.

Very briefly. Neoliberals don’t believe in the existence of a stable free market or that capitalism is pristine. Neoliberalism is a pluralistic ideology, which has the implication that a cleanly reified definition that pleases all parties is realistically out of the bounds of this essay

Neoliberalism has often been reduced to the intellectual strands of the Chicago school, Ordoliberalism, Austrian Economics, Libertarianism and even Neoclassical Economics.

Complaints that neoliberalism doesn’t really exist seems to display a naivete about the interaction of ideas and political movements.

Intro
The neoliberal continues to be stereotypically represented by the common conception of a neoclassical economist, a representation that does run into contradiction.

The term neoliberalism is hardly used to describe the US configuration of free market forces, forces which tends to sail under the flags of libertarianism or neoconservatism

Neoliberalism was developed in order to oppose what was described as collectivism and socialism through the development of an agenda diverging from classical liberalism

John Williamson coined the term “Washington Consensus (WC)”, the WC combined a set of macroeconomic policies intended to restore stability and a set of liberalisation policies aimed at structural reform.

Neoliberalism propagated doctrines of competition and entrepreneurship and posited the rejection of advancing
socialist ideas and bolshevism in particular. The conception of the state was in negative terms and classical liberalism loomed large.

The core message was the superiority of the market over state intervention

(Walter) Lippmann’s work was a discussion of totalitarianism defined in terms of the absence of property rights rather than the more common interpretation as the lack of democracy

The colloquium defined the concept of neoliberalism as:

The priority of the price mechanism
The free enterprise
The system of competition
A strong and impartial state
Whereas political freedom was regarded as a prerequisite of economic freedom in the British liberal tradition. Economics was now treated as quintessential to preserve a new kind of political freedom of individual choice.

The product of textbooks and the establishment of think tanks like the IEA were crucial to persisting neoliberal influence.

Chicago was the key staging ground for forging a lasting alliance between neoliberal intellecutals and the corporate opposition to the New Deal.
