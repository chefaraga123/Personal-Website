## **Preface**
- **Overview**:
  - This book offers profound insights into **[Neoliberalism](../notes/Neoliberalism)** and **liberalism**, surpassing other works on the subject while avoiding propagandistic promotion of these ideologies.
  - **Neoliberalism**:
    - Does not assume the existence of a pristine, stable free market.
    - A **pluralistic ideology**, resisting a singular, reified definition.

- **Key Observations**:
  - Neoliberalism often linked to intellectual strands like:
    - Chicago School
    - Ordoliberalism
    - Austrian Economics
    - Libertarianism
    - Neoclassical Economics.
  - Arguments against neoliberalismâ€™s existence reflect naivety about the interaction of ideas and political movements.

## **Introduction**
- **Stereotypes**:
  - Neoliberals often mischaracterized as neoclassical economists, despite contradictions in this representation.
  - In the U.S., "neoliberalism" rarely describes free-market ideologies, which instead align with **libertarianism** or **neoconservatism**.

- **Origins and Goals**:
  - Developed as an opposition to **collectivism** and **socialism**.
  - Focused on promoting:
    - **Competition** and **entrepreneurship**.
    - Rejection of socialist ideas, particularly **Bolshevism**.
  - Central message:
    - The **market** is superior to **state intervention**.

- **Key Figures and Concepts**:
  - **John Williamson**:
    - Coined the term *Washington Consensus* (WC):
      - Combined macroeconomic stability policies with liberalization reforms.
  - **Walter Lippmann**:
    - Defined totalitarianism through the absence of property rights rather than the lack of democracy.
