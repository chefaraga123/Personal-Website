# Notes from *Legal Systems Very Different from Ours*

---

## **Imperial Chinese Law**
- **Legalist vs. Confucian Dichotomy**:
  - **Legalist**: Use of rational incentives and equal treatment under the law to influence behavior.
  - **Confucian**: Advocates teaching virtue and supports unequal treatment based on status differences.
  - Resembles the shift in British criminal justice:
    - **18th century**: Deterrence-focused penalties.
    - **19th century**: Focused on reform and rehabilitation.

- **Key Features**:
  - Laws not formally promulgated; people assumed to know the correct course of action.
  - Verdicts based on **outcome**, not motivation (e.g., strict liability torts).
  - Legal consequences varied based on status, incentivizing avoidance of courts.

- **Structure of Authority**:
  - District magistrates forbidden to serve in their home province (similar to Ottoman governance).
  - Individuals subject to dual authority structures (e.g., familial and state).

- **Contracts Without Law**:
  - Elaborate contractual practices in the absence of formal contract law.
  - Non-state hierarchies often facilitated contract enforcement.

## **Amish Law**
- The Amish are a Protestant sect that emerged in the mid-18th century, selectively rejecting modern technology to preserve their social system.
- **Key Features**:
  - **Ordnung**: Set of rules governing congregation members (25–40 households per congregation).
    - Prohibits lawsuits, jury service, and political organization.
  - Informal enforcement:
    - Initial violations addressed through personal visits and repentance (level 1 punishment).
  - Governance includes:
    - Local autonomy within congregations.
    - Semi-formal biannual meetings of bishops to discuss and adjust rules.

- **Relationship with U.S. Government**:
  - Amish objected to **Social Security (1955)**, citing their religious obligation to care for each other.
  - Granted conscientious objector status.
  - **National Amish Steering Committee**: Negotiates conflicts between U.S. law and Amish practices.

## **Pirate Law**
- **Caribbean Piracy**:
  - Pirate crews (average 80 members) relied on self-governance due to the lack of state enforcement.
  - Challenges included:
    - Disincentivizing free-riding.
    - Centralizing decisions when needed without risking abuse of power.

- **Pirate Code**:
  - Democratically created articles regulating:
    - Crew decision-making.
    - Prohibitions against theft, gambling, and violence among crewmembers.
  - Compensation for injuries provided from the “public stock.”

- **Governance**:
  - **Quartermaster**:
    - Democratically elected and empowered to enforce the pirate code.
    - Could be deposed at any time.
  - **Divided Powers**: Balance between democratic participation and central enforcement.

## **Prisoner's Law**
- Prisoners face three primary challenges:
  1. **Safety**: Protecting themselves from violence.
  2. **Coordination**: Managing common resources.
  3. **Economy**: Regulating the underground market.

- **Prisoner’s Code**:
  - Informal rules enforcing property rights and resolving disputes.
  - Violators face social isolation and increased victimization risk.
  - Enforcement relies on individual convicts and peer pressure.

- **Evolution**:
  - As prison systems grew, maintaining informal codes became harder.
  - **Prison Gangs**:
    - Operate on a **community responsibility system**:
      - Each gang is responsible for its members’ actions and debts.
    - Gangs often have written constitutions and negotiate resolutions between rival groups.
    - Gang-based governance outperforms the prisoner’s code by lowering enforcement costs and simplifying reputation tracking.

## **Embedded and Paralegal Systems**
- Embedded legal systems face similar problems to formal legal systems but also unique challenges:
  - Must navigate interactions with overarching state laws.
  - Operate within existing societal structures, often filling gaps left by formal legal systems.
