Bentham’s panopticon — a hierarchical and pervasive surveillance experience as an automatic and anonymous expression of power (Foucault, 1977)

Intersection of the history of economics with the war story

Computers moved rapidly from the military setting to the natural and social sciences in the post-war period.

Question: what is economics about, Answer: the optimal allocation of scarce resources to given ends

Promulgated when neoclassical economics was displacing existing thought

Trade as the shifting about of endowments as to maximise an independent and given utility function

Static allocation has taken a backseat to understand agents’ capacities to deal with market situations

New modern answer: Economics is about the processing of information

The natural sciences and the history of economics

The history of neoclassical economics

Utility was patterned on the concept of potential energy in classical mechanics, the interpretation of the market was mechanical.

Science of causality

Examining the history of economics AND of the natural sciences and jointly evolving historical entities, not as independent bodies of knowledge. Diachronic vs synchronic?

Postwar developments in economics: game theory, RE theory, institutions, mechanism design, bounded rationality, etc…

Concept of natural order patterned on mechanical feedback systems

Machine rationality and regularity is a constant in the history of neoclassical economics

Economics assimilated many from the natural sciences

The relationship of an organism to its environment as a problem of communication of information

A world understood cybernetically is one of goal-oriented feedback mechanisms with learnings. The term cybernetics was applied indiscriminately.

A cyborg science is an ontology? Depends on the existence of the computer as a paradigm object.

Leaving the barries between nature and society intact. Meaning and symbol, intention and telelogy

Nature has taken on many attributes conventionally attributes to society, and humanity rendered more machine-like

As the distinction between the natural and the social grows increasingly vague, the distinction between reality and simulacra become harder to discern

The entire cold war military-technological trajectory was based on simulations

The computer began to blue the boundaries between the self-evident categories of experiment, instrument and theory

Claude shannon: “father of information theory”

Organic life is viewed as utilising energy to organise matter, digital life can be viewed as using CPU to organise memory. — Tom Ray

Military inspiration flowed into these sciences’ conceptual structures

Military rationale: Command, Control, Communications and Information

Problems of control engineering and of communication engineering were inseparable

The message is a sequence of measurable events distributed in time (a time series in statistics))

Neoclassicists assumed stable and well defined equilibria

Cyborg scientists assumed interested in irreversibility and the dissipation of effort


Cyborg science tended to parse its dynamics in terms of basins of attraction due to a ontological commitment to dissipation. More interested in thinking of agents in terms of heuristics and simple feedback rules

Knowledge vs information

Neoclassicists (NC) wanted their order simple and their a priori laws invariant

CSs preferred coimplexity and change.

NC — patterned off classical mechanics, whereas CSs patterned off biology

Aspects of metamathematics were oriented around godel’s incompleteness results

Clocks first disciplined the labouring body then became indistinguishable from it.

Pervasive determinism created problems for free will

18th century machine — product of the Newtonian universe

19th century machine — modelled on the thermodynamic engine, a motor,

Machine was capable of work only when compelled by some external source

The motor was regulated by internal dynamic principles, converting fuel into heat and heat into mechanical work

In what sense was the theory of evolution opposed to the physical dictates of thermodynamics

Maxwell’s demon (hypothetical in which the second law of thermodynamics is broke)

Conventional histories of computers start with people we could call economists, starting with the production of mathematical tables.

Computers originally referred not to machines but to people assigned to perform calculations

Babbage trying to mechanise the production of mechanical tables.

Difference engine — one form of arithmetic operation vs all purpose calculator the analytical engine

Charles Babbage wrote “On the Economy of Machinery and Manufactures”- a revision of Adam Smith’sa account of the division of labour

Marx leaned heavily on Babbage’s text

Architecture of the analytical engine — the first stored-program computer

Neoclassical theory shifted analytical focus from the social structure of the workplace to the class structure of society to the internal mental configurations of the generic economic agent

The very idea of a distributed organisation and control architecture evaporated

The telos of the neoclassical program has been to represent economic agents generically, conflicting with goals of divided labour according to specialisation?

William Jevons the inventor of neoclassical price theory

Jevons’ laws of thought: covered things and their signifiers & signs which represent them

Sought to break mathematics down into logic

Combinatorial and intensional vs extensional

Propositions and negations can be combined according to three basic principles of identity, noncontradiction and the law of the excluded middle

Kirchoff’s (Circuit) laws or Ohm’s law

Confusion over the relationship of logic to mathematics, of the relationship of syntax to semantics

Jevons sometimes credited with bringing probabilistic consideration into economics

Marginalist revolution = divorce of economics from computation

Two paths for economics

Babbage vs Jevons
Theory of computation buried in thermodynamics

Part of the destruction of the 18th century clockwork world order

We were stuck in natural circumstances that are inexorably running down

Intelligence as the ability to process information about the world

A challenge to thermodynamics was presented in biology through the phenomenon of evolution

Open systems as dynamos for conjuring order out of chaos

Second law of thermodynamics corresponds to the notion of physical gradients?

Synchronic vs diachronic perspective

One speaks of a law when a set of facts is governed by the same rule

Synchronic laws are general but not imperative
Synchronic laws appear to conflict with diachronic laws
Etymology and synchrony are different
Diachrony presupposes dynamic laws through which an effect is produced
Rudolf Clausius coined the term entropy in 1854 for the changes in the quantity of heat energy divided by absolute temperature in the thermal equilibrium of an ideal heat engine

Clausius noted that entropy was always positive in an irreversible system

Struggle for existence was a struggle for entropy, which becomes available through the transmission of energy from the hot sun to the cold earth

The demon as the triumph of life over death

Leo Szilard — drove development of the nuclear bomb, and following, its control

The treatment of DNA as code

An organism’s capacity redirect energy flows onto itself and hence escape decay into chaos

Shannon’s theory of communication

Violations of the second law of thermodynamics lead to physical interpretation of information

Cybernetics became a vehicle for a unified science of people and things

Shift from the sciences of energy to the sciences of information and control

Weiner — we live in a chaotic moral universe, in this our main obligation is to establish arbitrary enclaves of order and system

“Behavior, Purpose and Teleology”- a paper proposing a program of unified behaviourism to encompass all phenomena of intentionality under the formalism of prediction and feedback

Seductive philosophical systems are monistic (postulates unity of the origin of all things, and substance and essence)

Re body politic there is a lack of efficient homeostatic processes. There was the belief that the free market was a homeostatic process

Maintenance of the complexity of organisation and the use of randomness to produce through organisation (Von Neumman)

Control of randomness and dissolution through feedback (Weiner)

Weiner warned of the fallacies of using game theory to organise actual military strategies in a cold war environment


Ontological equivalence of brains and computers were a central tenet of cybernetics

For weiner entropy was ultimately something oppressive and harmful — to be neutralised

For Von Neuman it was fruitful

Claude Shannon and Information Theory

Interest in symbolic logic and electrical engineering

Mathematical theory of communication

Under a thermodynamic interpretation, increased entropy implies increased disorder & randomness

Shannon equates greater randomness as less redundancy in transmission

Thermodynamic entropy is a measure of the number of ways the unobserved microdynamics of molecules can make up a measurable macrostate like temperature

Shannon presupposes no macro-state

Amount sent + noise = amount received + missing information

“Semantically impoverished” theory of information

Developing metaprinciples about what was and what was not possible within formal systems

Difficult to write a history of computer science due to a struggle to coalesce around any unified formal doctrine

Although programming languages had the characteristics of mathematical symbolism they didn’t translate into mathematical structures

Formalist program hurt by the Godel assertion that any formal system adequate for the expression of number theory of arithmetic assertions could be found that were not tractable within that formal system

Mathematical biology (morphogenesis)


Cantor’s diagonal argument, used to show there were more real numbers than integers,even though both were treated as sets of infinite dimension

One can always define another uncomputable number from a set of computable numbers

Turing Machines have become central to a number of disciplines: foundational to theories of formal grammars and linguistics and theories of computational complexity

Imitation game = turing test

Turing’s thought experiment set forth the conflation of man with machine

The Advent of Complexity

UTM insofar it could in principle imitate the operation of any other machine, rendered it attractive as a baseline for the attempt to characterise different levels of the tractability of classes of problems.

Computational complexity — cost of a unit of calculation

Noam Chomsky defined an abstract language as a set of rules for producing strings of symbols from a finite alphabet

Some strings will qualify as legal and others not, the task Chomsky set about for was to formalise how a speaker would recognise those legitimate words and sentences patterned upon the analogous situation of a machine accepting a symbol string

Algorithmic procedures for the production of new strings = production rules

Various grammars can hence be taxonomised by how much machine power would be required


The most rudimentary languages could be recognised by the most rudimentary automata — i.e. a deterministic fixed state machine with no memory

The recursively enumerable language would require a complete Turing MAchine

Evolution is equated with scaling of the complexity hierarchy through emergent novel solutions

Time Complexity AND Space Complexity

The most famous complexity classes are denominated in terms of time requirements

John Von Neumman and economics

Spread of game theory throughout the core microeconomics curriculum since the 1980s

Axiomisation of the theory of expected utility

Debreu

1928 proof of the minimax theorem

Economics as an instantiation of the sciences of information processingt

Von Neumann advocated a pre-emptive first strike against russia as early as 1950

Marginalist approaches gives too much emphasis to substituability and too little to the forces which make for mutually condition expansion

Walrasian equations generate negative solutions

Von Neumann was never attracted to macro issues

Themes out of Quantum Mechanics

Causal account of QM vs the acausal interpretation associated with Niels Bohr (now caled the copenhagen interpretation)

Copenhagen interpretation argued that electron states existed as simultaneous possibilities until the act of observation caused the collapse of the wave packet to a classical particle

Quantum particles have no intrinsic properties independent of the measuring instrument

The observer has the capacity to exercise power over the constitution of reality

Von Neumann painted the 2-person game as having an intrinsically random component (due to mixed strategies) but also exhibiting determinate solutions in strategic play and outcomes

Reynolds number which demarcated the phase transition between laminar and chaotic turbulence

Von Neuman blurred the line between technical weapons consultant and military strategist

Description of neurons as highly sophisticated switchboard systems

The self organisation of information and communication through the process of struggle (friction??) could result in a kind of order

A logic of desire in economics — vN — leads to Karl Menger? (contributed to the development of game theory)

Phrasing the payroffs in terms of a cardinal entity termed utility

entropy — not energy, held the key to a modern interpretation of information processing

Formal theory of rationality independent of human psychology

For economic / social issues games (Should) fulfil the same function which various geometrico/matematical models have performed in the physical sciences

Think the isomorphism in the behaviour of different types of physical systems warratning consistent treatment

Chapter: Nature of the Linguistic Sign
The assertion that language reduced to its essential is a nomenclature, is predicated on the assumption that ideas already exist independently of words. Leading one to assume an unproblematic relationship between a thing and its name.

A linguistic sign is not a link between a thing and a name but between a concept and a sound pattern.

A sign is a combination of a concept and a sound pattern. The sensory part of the term implies reference to the whole.

The author proposes to use the word sign to designate the whole, but to replace concept and sound pattern respectively by signification and signal.

Signs which are entirely arbitrary convey better than others the ideal semiological process. The word symbol is sometimes used to designate the linguistic sign, or the part of the linguistic sign we call the signal. However a characteristic of symbols is that they are never entirely arbitrary. They show some degree of natural connection between the signal and its signification.

Chapter: Invariability and Variability of the Sign
The signal in relation to the idea it represents may seem freely chosen, however from the perspective of the linguistic community it is imposed rather than freely chosen. The community as much as the individual is bound to the language’s selection of signal.

The question of the origins of language is not even a relevant question as far as linguistics is concerned. The sole object of study in linguistics is the normal regular existence of an already-established language. Any given linguistic state is always the product of historical factors and these are factors which explain why linguistic sign is invariable.

Considering language as a social institutions, more generally, how do social institutions move through time and between generations. Linguistic changes don’t merely correspond to generations of speakers, for people of all ages intermingle and intercommunicate.

A language constitutes a complex system.

Languages are made use of all people at all times, quite unlike other social institutions, which are used certain number of individuals for a bounded time period.

A language is a product of social forces, although that description doesn’t elucidate why it came to be constrained in such a way. A language is always an inheritance from the past. Social forces act over a period of time. If stability is a characteristic of language, it is not only because languages are anchored in time and anchored in the community. A language is situated socially and chronologically by reference to a certain community and period of time.

Chapter: Static Linguistics and Evolutionary Linguistics
The need to take account of the passage of time gives rise to special problems in linguistics leading to two divergent paths of analysis.

Axis of simultaneity: concerns relations between things which coexist, relations from which the passage of time is excluded.

Axis of succession: one only considers one thing at a time.

For sciences which involve the study of values, this distinction becomes a practical necessity. The distinction between a system of values considered in terms of itself and these same values considered over a period of time.

The multiplicity of signs precludes any attempt to study simultaneously relations in time AND relations within the system. Hence we speak of synchronic linguistics and diachronic linguistics, relating to all which is static and all which concerns evolution respectively. A linguistic state vs a phase of evolution.,
