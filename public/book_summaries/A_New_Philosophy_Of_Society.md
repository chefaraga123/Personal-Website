# Notes from *A New Philosophy of Society* by Manuel DeLanda

---

## **Purpose of the Book**
- To describe the steps between **micro-** and **macro-perspectives** on social systems.
- Achieved through the use of the concept of **assemblages**, offering an alternative to reductionist approaches.

---

## **Core Concepts**
### **Assemblages vs. Organic Totalities**
- **Assemblages**:
  - Wholes whose properties emerge from interactions between parts.
  - Characterized by **relations of exteriority**, meaning:
    - Components retain autonomy and can be detached or reconfigured in new assemblages.
    - The properties of the whole arise from the capacities of its components in interaction, not as an aggregation of properties.

- **Organic Totalities**:
  - Wholes defined by **relations of interiority**:
    - Components are defined by their relations to other parts within the whole.
    - A part ceases to exist as what it is when removed from the whole.
  - Imply a seamless unity between parts and wholes.

---

## **Reductionism**
- **Micro-Reductionism**:
  - Exemplified by microeconomics.
  - Individuals are assumed rational; society is treated as an aggregate without emergent properties.
- **Macro-Reductionism**:
  - Views social structures as primary, with individuals as mere products of society.

---

## **Key Dimensions of Assemblages**
1. **Roles of Components**:
   - Components can play roles along a spectrum:
     - **Material**: Physical or tangible functions.
     - **Expressive**: Communicative or symbolic functions.
2. **Processes of Stabilization or Destabilization**:
   - Components can reinforce or undermine the assemblage’s identity.

---

## **Special Assemblages**
- **Genes**:
  - Composed of linear sequences of nucleotides; components of chromosomes.
- **Words**:
  - Composed of linear sequences of phonetic sounds or letters; components of sentences.
- **Assemblage Recurrence**:
  - Assembly processes recur at different spatial and temporal scales, linking micro- and macro-levels of reality.

---

## **Assemblages and Causality**
- **Linear Causality**:
  - The idea that the same cause always produces the same effect is limiting and misleading.
- **Non-Linear Causality**:
  - Defined by thresholds, below or above which external causes fail to produce an effect.
- **Material vs. Expressive Roles**:
  - Material components involve causal interactions.
  - Expressive components often catalyze these interactions.

---

## **Assemblages and Essentialism**
- Assemblages reject **taxonomic essentialism**:
  - Traditional classifications (e.g., genus, species, individual) treat categories as static and separate.
  - Assemblages are dynamic, with identities emerging from processes of interaction.

- Assemblages are characterized by:
  - **Flat Ontology**:
    - All entities (individuals, groups, societies) exist on the same ontological level, differing only in scale.
  - **Topological Structures**:
    - Connectivity and relationships define the space of possibilities for an assemblage.

---

## **Social Ontology**
- **Empiricist Tradition**:
  - Knowledge reduces to sense impressions; ideas replicate impressions.
- **Assemblages in Social Reality**:
  - Larger social assemblages have **objective existence**:
    - Causally affect their components (e.g., enabling or limiting individual actions).
    - Interact with other assemblages at the same scale.
- **Micro-Macro Linkage**:
  - Assemblages bridge individual entities and larger social entities through recurrent processes at various scales.

---

## **Applications**
### **Networks and Persons**
- Networks:
  - **Low-density networks**:
    - Feature weak links, providing novel information and opportunities.
  - **High-density networks**:
    - Feature strong links, offering resources and stability.
- Personal Identity:
  - Stable identity relies on maintaining habitual associations.

### **Social Dynamics**
- **Examples of Multi-Scale Assemblages**:
  - Napoleonic revolution in warfare:
    - Shift from local battles to national resource mobilization.
  - Resource mobilization involves overcoming inertia at various scales.

- **Temporal Consequences of Scale**:
  - Larger scales influence the duration and impact of events capable of altering assemblages.

---

## **DeLanda’s Assemblage Theory**
### **Key Features**:
1. Assemblages consist of self-subsistent parts linked by **relations of exteriority**.
2. Components can be detached and reconfigured in new assemblages.
3. Social and physical locales are shaped not only by their material form but also by recurring activities.

### **Synthesis of Micro- and Macro-Perspectives**:
- Assemblage theory explains how micro-level interactions produce macro-level structures and how macro-structures constrain micro-level activities.

---

## **Philosophical Implications**
- **Realist Ontology**:
  - Asserts the autonomy of social entities from our conceptions of them.
  - Social assemblages have **objective existence** through their causal effects.
- Assemblages reject rigid distinctions between levels of analysis:
  - Micro- and macro- scales are connected through dynamic, recurring processes.
- Social processes are shaped by constraints and affordances:
  - Components face limitations and opportunities that enable novel performances.

---

## **Conclusion**
- Assemblages offer a powerful framework for understanding the dynamic interactions between parts and wholes.
- By rejecting reductionism and embracing non-linear causality, assemblage theory bridges micro- and macro-perspectives on social systems.
