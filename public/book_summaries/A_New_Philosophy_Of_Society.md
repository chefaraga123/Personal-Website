The purpose of this book is to describe steps between micro- and macro- perspectives on social systems.

This starts through the consideration of:

Assemblages vs Organic Totalities

Relations of Exteriority vs Relations of Interiority

There are distinct types of reductionism. Consider micro-reductionism as typically exemplified through microeconomics, individuals agents have assumed rationality and society as a whole is conceptualised as a mere aggregate, i.e. as a whole without properties that are more than the sum of its parts. The opposing position is a macro-reductionism i.e that social structure is what really exists, individuals being products of the society in which they are born.

Wholes vs Assemblages
Assemblages are wholes whose properties emerge from the interaction between parts.

Networks are compared by the number of people they contain.

The awareness of the resemblance between classes, groups, social instituions and bodily organs is not new. Aristotle sets forth this organismic metaphor for describing society. Anthropomorphic analogies are used to describe the state (interesting to consider how this relates to the Aristotelian concept of Telos). However writers such as Hobbes and Rousseau rejected this equivocation, instead contrasting them.

A refinement of this organismic analogy is theory about the general relation between parts and wholes. The basic concept in this theory are the below

Relations of interiority: where the component parts are defined by their relations to the other parts in the whole. Here the part when detached from its whole ceases to be what it is, since being a part is one of its constitutive properties.

The above conception implies an inextricable unity

The main theoretical alternative to organic totalities are assemblages (Deleuze). These assemblages are defined above and are characterised by the below.

Relations of exteriority: these relations imply a component part of an assemblage may be detached and plugged into a different asssemblage in which its interactions are different. The implication is that the properties of the component parts can never explain the relations which constitute a whole. The exteriority of relations implies autonomy of the terms they relate.

The reason why the properties of a whole cannot be reduced to those of its parts is that they are not the result of an aggregation of the components’ own properties but of the actual excersize of their capacities.

In the context of relations of interiority the reason why the properties of a whole cannot be reduced to those of its parts is that they are the result not of an aggregation of the components’ own properties but of the actual excersize of their capacities. These capacitites involve reference to the properties of other interacting entities.

De Landa defines the concept of assemblages along two dimensions:

The variable roles which an assemblage’s components may play: from a purely material role to a purely expressive role.

The variable process through which the component either stabilises or destabilises the assemblage.

When atoms interact with radiation their internal structure creates patterns in this radiation through the selective absorption of some of its wavelengths. While this information has an objective existence it isn’t functional.

Special assemblages
Genes are made up of linear sequences of nucleotides and are the component parts of chromosomes.

Words are made of linear sequences of phonetic sounds or written letters and are the component part of sentences.

The combination of the recurrence of the same assembly processes at any one spatial scale and the recurrence of the same kind of assembly processes at successive scales gives assemblage theory a means of approaching the problem of linking the micro- & macro-levels of social reality.

The formula for linear causality: same cause, same effect always has had a damaging impact on the very conception of the relations between causes and effects. It is misleading to think that the occurrence of A implies B. IF causality is to provide the basis for objective syntheses causal relations must be characterized as productive (not just implicative!)

Assemblages & Essentialism
Taxonomists reify the general categories produced by the classifications. Taxonomic essentialism, as opposed to platonic variety, can be traced back to Aristotle

The enduring identity of a given species is accounted for in terms of the different forms of natural selection that steer the accumulation of genetic materials in the direction of greater adaptability, as well as the process through which two progressively divergent communities fail to mate. Reproductive isolation marks the threshold of speciation.

Only non-metric or topological notions, such as the overall connectivity of the different parts of the body, can be used to specify it. A body plan defines a space of possibilities, and this space has a topological structure.

Max Weber introduced a classification for social entities in terms of ideal types. He found three ways through which authority could gain legitimacy: traditional, rational-legal, and charismatic.

The dimensions of this space (the degrees of freedom of the authority structure) include:

The degree to which an office position in a hierarchy is clearly separated from the incumbent. Rational-legal forms have the most separation
The degree to which activities of the organisation are routinised. The charismatic form would have the least routine.
Social assemblages larger than individuals have an objective existence because they can causally affect the people that are their component parts, limiting them, and enabling them and affecting other assemblages at the same scale.

Persons and Networks
We need a point of departure for a bottom-up ontological model.

The empiricist tradition is best known for its epistemological claims, i.e. the claim that all knowledge, including verbal knowledge can ultimately be reduced to sense impressions.

An empiricist model conceptualises subjective experiences in terms of distinct and seperable sense impressions.

Ideas directly express impressions.

A personal identity is stable only to the extent that habitual or routine associations are constantly maintained.

Ideas as low intensity replications of impressions.
