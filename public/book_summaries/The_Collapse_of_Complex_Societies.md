# The Objective
The objective of this work is to develop a general explanation of collapse, applicable within a variety of contexts and with implications for current conditions. This is a work of archaeology and history and of social theory.

## Collapse
A society is collapsed when it displays a rapid drop in sociopolitical complexity.

## Collapses in History
- **The Indus Valley Civilization**
- **Mesopotamia**
- **The Egyptian Old Kingdom**
  - The unification of Upper and Lower Egypt is typically tied to ~3100 BC.
- **Western Chou**
- **The Hittite Empire**
- **Minoan Civilization**
  - Of Crete, was the first in Europe.
  - The Phaistos disk is the oldest known example of printing made from movable type impressed into the clay.
- **Mycenaean Civilization**
- **The Western Roman Empire**
  - By the end of the 3rd/4th centuries, Diocletian and Constantine restored order for a time.
  - The last Roman Empire of the west was deposed in 476 AD.
- **The Olmec**
- **The Lowland Classic Maya**
- **The Mesoamerican Highlands**
- **The Chacoans**
- **The Hohokam**
- **The Eastern Woodlands**
- **The Huari and Tiahuanaco Empires**
- **The Kachin**
- **The Ik**

# Chapter 2: The Nature of Complex Societies

## In this chapter, three things are discussed:
1. The nature of complexity.
2. The question of whether complexity is a continuum or discretely characterised.
3. Major views on the emergence of complex societies.

---

## Two concepts important to understanding the nature of complexity:
1. **Inequality**
   - May be thought of as vertical differentiation.
2. **Heterogeneity**
   - A subtler concept; it refers to the number of distinctive parts or components of a society and to the way in which society is distributed across them.

- Inequality and heterogeneity are interrelated but, in part, respond to different processes and are not always positively correlated in sociopolitical evolution.

---

## Characteristics of Complex Societies
- Complex societies tend to be “nearly decomposable systems.” That is, they are at least partly built up of social units that are themselves potentially stable and independent.
- For example, a newly established state may include several formerly independent villages, or an empire may incorporate previously established states.
- A collapse process may result in the reversion to the constituent elements of the lower level of complexity.

---

## States
- States are territorially organised.
  - Membership is at least partly determined by birth or residence in a territory rather than kin relations.

- States contrast with relatively complex tribal societies such as chiefdoms in a number of ways:
  - In states, a ruling authority monopolises sovereignty and delegates all power.
  - The ruling class tends to be professional and not bound by kinship.
  - This ruling class supplies the personnel for government.
  - The government is legitimately constituted.
  - States are the only kind of human society that does not ordinarily undergo short-term cycles of formation and dissolution.
  - States are internally differentiated. Specialisation is a clear characteristic, which is often reflected in patterns of residence.

## Durkheim's Perspective
- Recognised the evolution from primitive to complex societies witnessed the transformation of groups based on what he denoted as:
  - **Mechanical solidarity**: Found in primitive societies.
  - **Organic solidarity**: Found in complex societies, characterised by cultural and economic differentiation requiring interaction and greater cohesiveness.

---

## Legitimacy
- Despite an institutionalised authority structure, an ideological basis, and a monopoly of force, rulers of states still need to constantly reinforce their legitimacy.
- Legitimacy mainly declines when authorities are unable to meet the demands of the support population.

---

## Levels of Complexity
- One of the basic assumptions of the typological approach is that as societies increase in complexity, they do so by leaps from one structurally stable level to another.
- The alternative approach is that increases in complexity operate along a continuous scale.
- In the process of classification, information about variety is lost while information about similarities is gained.
- The utility of a classification must be at least partially judged by whether the quantity and quality of information gained outweigh what is lost.

---

## Types of Early States
1. **The inchoate early state**
   - Kinship and family ties dominate political relations.
   - Limited specialisation.
   - Ad hoc taxation.
2. **The typical early state**
   - Kinship balanced by ties to locality.
   - Competition and appointment counterbalance heredity.
   - Leading administrative roles are allocated to non-kinsmen.
3. **The transitional early state**
   - Kinship affects only marginal aspects of government.

---

## The Evolution of Complexity
- The origins of complex societies remain controversial.
- Long-standing states have acquired in their later history so many functions and features that their original functions are often obscured.

---

## Major Lines of Thought Around the Origin of the State
1. **Managerial**
2. **Internal conflict**
3. **External conflict**
4. **Synthetic**

---

## Secondary State Formation
- The emergence of complexity among the competitors and trade partners of states yields the process of secondary state formation.
- So far, there have been only six instances of primary state formation.

---

## Schools of Thought on the Origin of the State

### Conflict Theory
- Asserts that the state emerged out of the needs and desires of individuals and subgroups of a society.
- Based on divided interests, domination, and exploitation, and primarily a stage for power struggles.
- Its clearest expression is in the Marxist school.

### Integrationist/Functionalist Theory
- Suggests that complexity, stratification, and the state arose from the needs of society.
- Major elements of this approach:
  - Shared rather than divided interests.
  - Common advantages instead of dominance and exploitation.
  - Consensus, not coercion.
  - Societies as integrated systems rather than stages for power struggles.
