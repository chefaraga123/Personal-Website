## **Chapter 2: The Standard Narrative and the Bigger Picture**
- **Key Observations**:
  - Professional economists have aimed to achieve **scientific status** for their field, elevating **information** as a central theoretical construct.
  - The **information revolution** predates the internet and related technologies.
  - **Rationality** in economics depends on clarifying what it means for an agent to "know" something.

- **Shifting Focus**:
  - Early economics emphasized **production of national physical wealth**.
  - Over time, focus shifted to **exchange** and intangible factors like **information**.

- **Examples of Information in Economics**:
  - **Efficient Markets Hypothesis** (Finance).
  - **Common Knowledge** (Game Theory).
  - **Rational Expectations** (Macroeconomics).
  - **Asymmetric Information** (Principal-Agent Theory).
  - **Adverse Selection** (Mechanism Design).
  - **Focal Points** (Behavioral Economics).

- **Philosophical Consideration**:
  - Distinction between **knowledge** and **information**:
    - Knowledge is harder to reify and contextual.
    - Historical conditions of the 1940s were prerequisites for the emergence of **knowledge economics**.

- **Epistemic Questions**:
  - What qualifies as information, and how has its role evolved?
  - Has information seamlessly integrated into neoclassical models, or has it challenged them?

## **Chapter 3: Natural Science Inspirations**
- **Historical Roots**:
  - **Entropy** first conceptualized in thermodynamics (late 19th century).
  - **Shannon’s Information Theory** (20th century):
    - Equated entropy with information.
    - Rendered semantic aspects of communication irrelevant, focusing purely on quantitative transmission.

## **Chapter 4: The Nobels and the Neoliberals**
- **Key Themes**:
  - Intersection of information economics with neoliberal thought.
  - Influence of figures like **Hayek** and **Samuelson** in reframing markets as mechanisms for aggregating and disseminating knowledge.

---

## **Chapter 5: The Calculation Controversy**
- **Background**:
  - Sparked by Ludwig von Mises’ paper arguing that socialism would fail due to the inability to perform rational economic calculation without market pricing.

- **Shifts in Debate**:
  - **Hayek’s Contribution**:
    - Initially aligned with Mises, later reframed the issue:
      - Market success lies in its ability to **integrate and disseminate dispersed knowledge**.
    - Proposed that markets serve not just to allocate resources but to coordinate knowledge.

- **Paul Samuelson**:
  - Credited this reframing as the foundation of **information economics**:
    - Markets seen as knowledge aggregation tools that preserve decentralization.

## **Chapter 6: Hayek Changes His Mind**
- **Evolving Ideas**:
  - Hayek argued that while knowledge is dispersed and hard to centralize, it could still be articulated to some extent.
  - In *The Use of Knowledge in Society* (1945), Hayek reimagined markets as mechanisms for **information communication**.

- **Tacit Knowledge**:
  - In 1952, Hayek suggested much human knowledge is:
    - **Tacit**: Not easily articulated.
    - **Inaccessible**: Even to the individual possessing it.
  - Revived **associationist psychology**, positing that the mind operates via opaque classifier algorithms.

- **Implications**:
  - Knowledge became increasingly disengaged from the individual knower.

## **Chapter 7: The Neoclassical Economics of Information was Incubated at Cowles**
- **Cowles Commission**:
  - Key site for developing neoclassical information economics.
  - **Kenneth Arrow** (Research Associate, 1947):
    - Advanced theoretical foundations of information economics.
  - Socialist Calculation Controversy:
    - Seen as a major intellectual challenge to **market socialists** and their vision for economists’ societal roles.
