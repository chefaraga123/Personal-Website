General sociological theory: the general question of how a social order is possible at all 

What are the conditions for the persistence of a social system? And what are the conditions for the existence of a society? 

What minimal conditions concerning maintenance and problem solving must be fulfilled so that a society can exist at all?

My Notes: Is Luhmann arguing for a “structural functionalism” that bridges the given sociological dichotomy and hence denoting that Systems Theory?

Core ideas: how to integrate problems of deviance, the limitations of social control, of value contradictions 
“Action is system” 

Reference to Parson’s 2x2 matrix and its property of being MECE 

Theory of action seen as oriented towards the subject & the individual, whereas systems theory is seen as abstract and perhaps more capable at depicting macro-structures 

Connection between system formation or overarching ordering structures on the one hand and actions as the basal operations on the other. 


Parsons proposes that actions are an emergent property of reality
There are components that need to be combined for actions to emerge
For a primary understanding of actions need to distinguish ends and means 
What are the values that society uses to restrict the freedom of choice concerning the combination of means and ends

Lecture 3: The Theory of Open Systems 
Systems thinking is conceptualised as an interdisciplinary mode of thought
Points of departure of general systems theory 
A line of development can be seen with the models deal with the concept of an equilibrium
This has a mathematical basis, but conceptually it has a mathematically independent existence - used in economics in the 17th century e.g. ideas of “balance of trade” or the “balance of power” as between nations 
This line of development is characterised by the distinction between stability & disturbance. The idea of equilibrium can be understood that marks and locates a system’s sensitivity to disturbance 
Maybe imbalance/disequilibrium is the requisite condition for stability 
The most novel issue that arises when taking an equilibrium model as the basis of a general systems theory is given by thermodynamics, that the physics of closed systems tends to produce entropy (i.e. to dissolve distinctions) 
Negentropy - used in the context of situations where there is decrease in entropy / increase in order 

An open system concerns the exchange relationship between a system and its environment 





General sociological context:
Structuralism
Emphasises how the different elements of society fit together into a coherent stable structure (a reductionist approach)
Functionalism 
Views society as a complex systems whose parts work together to promote solidarity and stability, emphasises the interdependence of the institutions and processes of society and how they work together to maintain the system as a whole. (an emergentist approach)
