Introduction
Is there a metaphysical structure of historical humanity?

Something independent of its outward forms: social, spiritual and political. These actualities must be derived from something?

Is all history founded upon general biographic archetypes?

The means to understanding dead forms is mathematical law, and the means to understanding living forms is analogy.

Analogies may be a blessing to historical thought.

The world-as-history in contrast to the world-as-nature.

Taking spiritual-political events and arranging them into a scheme of causes and effects is just part of natural science.

Mathematics and the principal of causality lead to a naturalistic chronology and a historicla ordering of the phenomenal world.

Nature is the shape in which the man of a higher culture understands their sense-impresssions. History is used to comprehend the living existence of the world in relation to one’s own life.

The classical culture possessed no memory or organ of history. Classical history is essentially a product of mythological thinking. What they wanted was a myth NOT history.

No one has seriously considered the possibility have an alloted span of life and may be attached as forms of self-expression to particular regions and types of mankind.

Mankind is a zoological expression or an empty word.

Most values are local and temporary.

World-history denotes a totality not a selected part.

Any philosophical question is really a veiled desire to get an explicit affirmation of what is implicit in the question itself.

Goethe’s Living Nature is world-as-history.

World-as-mechanism as contrasting with world-as-organism. Dead nature to living nature. Law to form.

What is civilisation — understood as the organic-logical sequel fulfilment and finale of a culture. Every culture has its own civilisaiton, civilisaiton being the inevitable destiny of culture. The thing-become succeeding the thing-becoming.

The Meaning of Numbers
“the become is always founded on a becoming and not the other way round”

The possibility is called the future and the actualised past. The actualising itself, we call the present.

History and Nature correspond to different possible modes of understanding. Becoming or the become, direction (“time”) or extension (“space”).

Differentiate between possible and actual culture, i.e. cultura as an idea in the exstence and culture as the body of that idea.

Number is the symbol of causal necessity. All becoming possess the original property of direction (irreversibility) all things-become possess the property of extension.

Nature is the numerable, whilst history on the other hand is the aggregate of that which has no relation to mathematics.

Exact natural science reaches just as far as the possibilities of applied mathematics allowed it to reach. Discovery of certain inventions can be framed as corresponding to a feeling for numbers of a class referred to as higher geometry.

There are several number-worlds as there are several cultures. Each type of number corresponds to some specific expression of some world feeling.

Kant classified the sum of human knowledge according to syntheses:

a priori: necessary and universally valid
a posteriori: experiential and variable from case to case
There is no sharp distinction as implied by the categorisation. If mathematics were a science it would be possible to define the object.

The most valuable thing in the classical mathematic is its proposition that number is the essence of all things perceptible to the senses. Defining number as a measure. Measurement means something near and corporeal.

Something that is chaos, is something not yet actualised. As an opposite to the state of chaos is the state of cosmos which for the classical soul implies a cleared up situation of the external world.

All classical mathematics is at its bottom stereometry (solid geometry)

Euclid defines a line as length without breadth

Classical number is a thought process dealing not with spatial relations but with visibly limitable and tangible units, and it follows naturally and necessarily that classical knows only the natural (positive integers) numbers. Irrational numbers were unrealisable. The irrational number separates the notion of a number from that of magnitude, for the magnitude of an irrational number can never be exactly represented by a straight line.

Measure is in contrast to the immeasurable

The decisive act of Descartes whose geometry appeared in 1637 consisted of the conceptual emancipation of geometry from servitude to optically realisable constructions and to measured and measurable lines more generally. With this the analysis of the infinite became a fact. Descartes spawns a new geometry which is no longer 3-D, “ a manifold of points”, a synthetic work upon the position of points in space.

Numbers as pure magnitude vs numbers as pure relation.

The power, which initially denotes a set of multiplications is through the exponential idea (logs) is disassociated from all connections with magnitude and transferred to a transcendent relational world.

They are not numbers at all but signs representing a connection that is destitute of the hallmarks of magnitude. Whole equations unfortunately being written as plurality of terms

Once the space-element or point had lost its last persistent relic of visualness and instead of being represented to the eye as a cut in co-ordinate lines, was defined as three independent numbers. There was no objection to changing 3 to n. The notion of dimension was changed.

The aggregate of all points of n-dimensions is called an n-dimensional space.

Groups are aggregates/sets of homogeneous mathematical images.

Nature and history are the opposite extremes of man’s range of possibilities

An actuality is a nature insofar that it assigns things-becoming their place as things become.

And history insofar as it orders things become in reference to their becoming

The laws of nature are forms of inorganic necessity. Mathematics as the things become number is associated with laws and causality

All physical processes run a course in place / all physical processes occur between bodies.
