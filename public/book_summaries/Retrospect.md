Chapter 1
McNamara taught in the Statistical Control Program during WW2
McNamara became president of Ford in 1960
JFK as President elect invited him to be secretary of the treasury and then secretary of defense, 
McNamara was invited on the basis of being an atypical, innovative, effective businessman 
The constitution says that the military is under direct civilian control 
The complexity of the military establishment had undermined the civilian authority’s capacity to meaningfully control on its own terms 
Sought to subordinate the institutional interests of the armed services & defense contractors to a broad conception of national interest. Effectively wanted to rationalise decision making in the Pentagon 
Shifted from a one-year to a five-year planning period 
Instituted the planning, programming, budgeting system to clarify procurement choices. This system worked by forcing long-term effectiveness comparisons across service lines for weapons systems, force structures and strategies 
Sought to integrate foreign policy & the defense budget 

Define a clear objective for the organisation; systematically monitor progress against the plan. If progress was inadequate one could adjust the plan or introduce corrective action to accelerate progress. 

Kennedy administration was concerned that the reliance on Nuclear weapons lead to insufficient resource to counter non-nuclear attacks without commiting suicide
Shifted from a strategy of massive retaliation to a more flexible response 

Early in 1960 the Eisenhower administration had authorised the CIA to organise, arm & train 1,400 Cuban exiles to overthrow Castro. Castro had seized power the year before and was leaning into the Soviet orbit. 
<90 days after inauguration Kennedy had to make the call about whether to go ahead with the operation. The invasion took place in April 1961 “the bay of pigs” and was a complete disaster. 

Chapter 2
Throughout the Kennedy years the administration operated on two ultimately contradictory premises:
That the fall of South Vietnam would threaten the West
That the South Vietnamese could defend their nation & that American should limit its role ot providing training and logistical support
Given the latter view there were plans for phased withdrawal from Vietnam in 1963.
Operating on the basis of containment put forward by George Kennan in 1947. 
Ho Chi Minh of North Vietnam had freed the country from French rule in WW1 and that Japan occupied Vietnam during WW2. 
What are now seen as nationalistic movements were viewed as the monolithic push of a communistic threat 
Ho Chi Ming was seen as a communist first, nationalist second 
$7bn in aid went into South Vietnam 1955 - 1961 
The premise of action was the grave assumption that to lose Laos/Vietnam would lead to the loss of all of SEA
Dilemma: if there was a strong S.Vietnamese effort - troops not needed, if an apathetic S.Vietnamese US Forces wouldn't be able to accomplish their mission 
The South Vietnamese President Ngo Dinh Diem lacked basic connections to the South Vietnamese people, never bonded with them. 
No one was satisfied with the information received from Vietnam. 
Sir Robert Thompson lead the successful campaign against guerillas in Malaya during the 1950s and was head of the British Advisory mission in South Vietnam 
The South Vietnamese tended to generate reports that they thought the Americans wished to hear 
US viewed it as a military operation when it was nationalistic and internecine(destructive to both sides) struggle. 
Uncertain how to evaluate results in war without battle lines the military tried to gauge progress with quantitative measurements such as enemy casualties, weapons seized, prisoner's taken, sorties flown etc… 
Political & religious issues internal to S.Vietnam generated further instability 

Chapter 3
The USA set in motion a military coup in 1963
Max Taylor the President’s military advisor 
Roger Hilmsman Assistant secretary of state often subverted proper channel 
The CIA assassinated the South Vietnamese President?
They tacit supported a military coup 
 De Gaulle advocated for neutralisation i.e. the formation of a coalition of warring faction as per what happened in Laos.  
Mao & Ho Chi Minh thought Diem was not so bad 
The coup lead to a political vacuum in south Vietnam & the loss of any basis for proceeding on course compatible with US objectives
Lodge (ambassador) believed that the coup would shorten the war 
Ultimately 500,000 troops were deployed to Vietnam 





Chapter 4: The Tonkin Gulf Resolution
The Johnson administration used the attacks on US ships in the Tonkin Gulf as a way to justify the constitutionality of the military actions it took in Vietnam 1965-> 
Congressional resolution was passed that permitted but didn’t intend for the emergence of a full scale war 


Chapter 9: Troubles Deepen (Jan 1966 - May 1967)
At the beginning of 1966 McNamara suggested to LBJ, on the basis of recommendations from General Westmoreland, to increase troop levels from 179,000 to 368,000 by end of year.
Between 1965 & 1967 Westmoreland pursued an attrition strategy aimed at inflicting more casualties on the VC than they could replace, however this strategy failed and the VC forces grew significantly 1966->’67. 
South Vietnamese provided poor intelligence & inaccurate, number of given reasons
Purposeful attempts to mislead
Optimism bias 
Difficult to accurately gauge progress 
Sought to measure progress 

I have gone by the rule that it is not enough to conceive of an objective and a plan to carry it out; you must monitor the plan to determine whether you are achieving the objective. If you discover you are not you must revise the plan or change the objective …. While we might not have something as unambiguous as a front line, we could find variables that would indicate success or failure. So we measured the targets destroyed in the north, the traffic down the Ho Chi Minh trail, the number of captives, the weapons seized, the enemy body count and so on. 

The vietcong and North Vietnamese still largely controlled their casualties by choosing where when and how long to fight 

Failed to coordinate diplomatic and military actions in pursuit of an end to the war
Turning point of the war in the media was late 1966 
Buddhist uprising in South Vietnam underscored the Saigon government’s fragility & lack of popular appeal 
Military force cannot bring order to a country that cannot govern itself. 
The North Vietnamese were attriting US morale, even if the US was inflicting large numbers of casualties 
In March 1967 Westmoreland requested an increase in troop numbers from 470,000 to 670,000. 


Chapter 10: In Estrangement & Departure (May 1967 - Feb 1968)
In the Summer of 1967 there were a number of international issues, war in the middle east, a soviet Anti-Ballistic missile program, a conflict between Greece & Turkey over Cyprus, race riots & increasing anti-war protests 
There was a fragmentation of beliefs across and within the civilian and military authorities 


Chapter 11: The Lessons of Vietnam 
Lee Kwan Yew saw the costs imposed by the Vietnam war as justified 
McNamara ponders a few specific situations under which America had a legitimate claim to withdraw 
Lessons
Misjudged the political aspirations of the adversaries and exaggerated the domestic security threat 
Misjudged South Vietnam’s internal political aspirations 
Underestimated the power of nationalism to motivate a people 
Failed to recognise the limitations of high-tech military equipment and doctrine when confronting unconventional highly motivated people’s movements. 
Failed to organise the executive branch to deal effectively with the range of complexity faced associated with the application of military force under substantial constraints over a long period of time 

“We have lost our rivals what will we put in their place”
