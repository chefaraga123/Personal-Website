Ferdinand de Saussure

Chapter: Introduction
Ferdinand de Saussure is generally regarded as the founder of linguistic structuralism. Where structuralism is any theory in which language is conceived as self-contained, self-regulating system whose elements are defined by their relations to other elements.

Chapter: Brief Introduction to the History of Linguistics
The study of linguistic facts passed through three phases before tending onto its true object of study.

First came grammar, a discipline based logic that offers no scientific or objective approach to language past distinguishing correct and incorrect forms. Next came philology, which seeks to study texts. Then the comparison of linguistic structures, known as comparative grammar. Linguistics emerged from Romance Studies.

Chapter: Data and Aims of Linguistics
The aim of linguistics will be to:

describe all known languages and record their history
determine the forces operating permanently & universally on all languages
delimit and define linguistics
Chapter: The Object of Study
Linguistic phenomena always present complementary facets that depend on the other. The ear preceives articulated syllables as auditory impressions, however the sounds wouldnt exist without the vocal organs. One cannot divorce what is heard from oral articulation. Speech sounds are only the instrument of thought and have no independent existence. Language at any point is an institution in the present and a product of the past.

What is linguistic structure? It is not equivalent to language, it is an essential component of.

It is not clear that our vocal apparatus are made for speaking as our legs are for walking. In order to identify the role of linguistic structure within language we must consider what takes place in the speech circuit.

Starting point of this circuit is the brain of a single individual, where facts of conciousness (concepts) are associated with representations of linguistic signs or sound patterns by means of which they may be expressed.


This schemitisation allows us to identify the parts of the speech circuit, its physical, physiological and psychological components.

Languages and their place in human affairs: Semiology

A language is a social institution, a language is a system of signs representing ideas. It is possible to conceive of a science studying the role of signs as part of social life. The role of the linguist is to define what makes language a special system in the context of the general study of signs.

The linguistic sign is inherently social in nature.

Chapter: Linguistics of Language and Linguistics of Speech
The vocal organs as external to language as the electrical system is external to computer code. Phonation, i.e the execution of sound patterns doesnt affect the system itself (interesting?).

The study of language comprises two parts: the essential part which is language itself which is social in its essence and the subsidiary part which is speech.

A language as a collective phenomenon takes the form of a totality of imprints in brains. Speech is the sum total of what people say, comprising individual combinations of words and voluntary acts of phonation which are necessary for the execution of the speakers’ combination of words.

Chapter: Internal and External Elements of a Language
Our definition of a language assumes the

Colonisation transports the language into new environments, hence bringing changes in the language.

Advance stages of civilisation favour the development of certain special languages (legal, scientific terminology).

The linguist must examine the reciprocal relations between the language of colloquial speech and the language of books.

Every language has its own geographical area, even though geography has nothing to do with the internal structure of the language.

Chapter: Representation of a language by writing
Languages are known mainly to us by writing. Although writing is not part of the internal system of the language it cannot be ignored. A language and its written form constitute two systems of signs. The reason for the existence of the written form is to represent the language.

Linguistic stability is by no means undermined by the absence of a written form. There is a distinction between letters and sounds. A language has a writing-independent oral tradition, however the prestige of the written form gets in the way of this. The written form of a word is a permanent solid object which is more fitting than its sound to act as a persitent linguistic unit. The connection between a word and its written form is a purely artificial unit.

Systems of writing

There are only two systems of writing (necessarily exhaustive? I’m not sure)

The ideographic system in which a word is represented a sign that has nothing to do with the sounds involved.
The phonetic system, intended to represent the sequence of sounds as they occur in the word. Some phonetic writing systems are syllabic, others alphabetic, i.e. based upon the irreducible elements of speech.
Ideographic writing systems can develop into mixed systems, where some ideograms lose their original significance, eventually coming to represent isolated sounds.

A cause of the discrepancy between spelling and pronunciation is the borrowing of an alphabet by one people for another. when the resources of the graphic system are poorly adapted to its new function.

Writing obscures our understanding of the language.

Chapter: Physiological Phonetics
The primary requirement of the linguist is that that writing should provide a system for representing sounds which is free from ambiguity. What are the principles underlying an adequate system of transcription?

It should provide a symbol for each unit in the sequence of spoken sounds.
