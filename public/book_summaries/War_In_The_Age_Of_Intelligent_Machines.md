Introduction
Autonomous weapons and battle management systems were announced as two key goals for military research in the 1980s & ’90s. This announcement was made in a 1984 document entitled “strategic computing”

Robotic intelligence will likely not follow the anthropomorphic line of development

A robot historian dedicated to understanding its historical origins would write a different kind of history to its human counterparty.

When motors came along people began to realise that many natural systems behave like motors: they run on an external reservoir of resources and exploit the labour performed by circulating flows of matter and energy.

Napoleon’s armies could be viewed as a motor running on a reservoir of populations and nationalist feeling

The logical structures of computer hardware were once incarnated in the human body in the form of empirical problem-solving recipes

The migration across physical scales, the carrying of logical structures from vacuum tubes to transistors, and then to integrated chips (which etch the basic form of the three legged transistor onto a thin silicon wafer).

De Landa is simulating a robot historian, by tracing the applications of AI from the POV of the historian

War as a machine that integrates men and machines, tools and weapons.

Areas of war affected by the introduction of computers:

Cruise missiles
Radar
Control
Command and communications networks
War games
Systems of numerical control and computerised logistics
Picture a military institution as a machine composed of several distinct levels, all of which have been integral components of armies since antiquity:

The level of weapons and the hardware of war
The level of tactics, in which men and weapons are integrated into formationsd
The level of strategy in which the battles fought by those formations acquire a unified political goal
The level of logistics, of procurement, and supply network
If advances in computer technology have affected the military, the opposite is also true. The discipline of operations research evolved into the more inclusive management science/ systems analysis. Which effectively transfers the command and control structures of military logistics to the rest of the society and the economy,

The CIA and the NSA divide their roles according to the section of the electro magnetic spectrum they police

Computers have allowed for the investigation of natural processes of self-organisation.

To provide a clearer idea of what these processes of spontaneous “cooperative behaviour” are, consider a few examples: the individual spin of atoms in a metal cooperate to make the metal magnetic

These processes can be described by the same abstract mathematical model.

Humans would have served as machines’ surrogate reproductive organs until robots acquired their own self-replication ability.

Order emerges out of chaos only at certain critical points

In many computer networks there is no central controller, instead messages possess some kind of “local intelligence” which is used to find their destination.

Mathematical models of the outbreak of war have been created and they suggest that the onset of armed conflict is v similar to the onset of turbulence in a flowing liquid

Chapter one: Collision Course
Two distinct ways of waging war & two primary methods for organising armed forces:

Nomadic war machines e.g. Genghis Khan
Sedentary war machines ee.g. Greeks & Romans
(From which modern armies evolved)

1494 marks the turning point in the competition between nomadic & sedentary armies — invention of the mobile cannon. Cannon thus became as available as siege/field artillery

Integration of artillery into the art of war led to the development of a new paradigm of military architecture — high walls no longer useful

Gunpowder shift balance in favour of sedentary armies.

Tight formations and linear tactics gradually gave way to small units capable of displaying local initiative and of performing flexible manoeuvres

Chaos theory: military interest in turbulent phenomena revolves around the question of its negative effects in the performance of weapons systems or the effect of air drag on projectiles or water drag on submarines.

While turbulence seems chaotic on the macroscopic scale it corresponds to massively coherent behaviour on the microscopic scale.

Transitions from chaos to order are said to be mechanism independent i.e. only the mathematical structure of these transitions matters.

The critical point in mass defining the onset of fission had to be tracked in different substances and the different ways of triggering fission had to be developed

Modern scientists track singularities through computers, whilst weapon artisans of olds had to track them following “traits of expression” i.e. physical properties

Critical points in the size of urban masses or in the distribution of political and economic power could be among the contributing factors in the “self-assembly” of the different armies in history.

Arthur Iberall developed a model of human history in which societies are pictured as ensemble of fluxes and reservoirs driving the fluxers: water, metabolic energy, population, trade, technology

The machines produced as the output of each level (weapons, battles, wars, etc..) may be seen as units of assembly for the next level up the scale.

Function of firearms may be divided into three stages: the propulsion stage, the ballistic stage and the impact stage.

The first firearms, the hand cannon of the 14th century, lacked a specific mechanism for any of the above 3 functions. A smoothbore tube served as the only guidance mechanism.

In order to study trajectories engineers created simplified models of the dynamical system of the moving body and the viscous medium it moved through. They had to disregard the effects of drag and friction.

The next stage in the development of the wall occured with the development of the bomber plane forcing the fortress to dematerialise into the electronic radar curtain.

As soon as the sound barrier was broken the blind spots in the radar curtain became corridors for enemy aircraft.

Military hardware is not as important as its software, the human element

In the armies of Frederick the Great, individual initiative was practically reduced to zero.

A tactical unit may be seen as an information processing machine, in order for an officer to control a unit the formation needs to be able to transmit the commands issued from above and feedback compliance to the commanding officer.

Friction is an important military concept, it refers to the physical friction of breakdown and delays in transportation and communication networks. More generally used to describe any phenomenon that interferes with the implementation of a strategic or tactical plan.

The problem with centralisation is how instead of maximising certainty at the top it ends up increasing the overall amount of uncertainty: withdrawing all responsibility from individual soldiers involves needing to define commands in extreme detail and check compliance with those demands. Some military outfits have organised mission-oriented tactics, decentralised schemes that establishes goals to be achieved and leaves it to the tactical unit to achieve those goals.

In order to maintain cohesion within the clockwork mechanism soldies had to be taught to fear commanding officers more than their enemy.

Clockwork relies on external sources of motion, motors do not.
