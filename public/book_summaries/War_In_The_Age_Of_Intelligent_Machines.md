## Key Concepts
- **Complex Systems**
- **Friction**
- **Decentralisation**
- **Discipline**
- **Emergent Order**
- **Dynamic Modelling**

## Introduction
- In the 1980s and ’90s, **autonomous weapons** and **battle management systems** were announced as key military research goals. This was outlined in a 1984 document titled *Strategic Computing*.
- **Robotic intelligence** is unlikely to follow an anthropomorphic line of development.
- A hypothetical **robot historian** might write history differently from a human counterpart, tracing origins in unique ways.

---

## Key Ideas
- Many natural systems behave like motors, running on external reservoirs of resources and exploiting the labor of circulating flows of matter and energy.
  - Example: Napoleon’s armies could be seen as a motor fueled by populations and nationalist feeling.

- The logical structures of **computer hardware** were once embodied in human problem-solving recipes.
  - Evolution from vacuum tubes to transistors to integrated chips mirrors this migration of logic across physical scales.

- De Landa simulates a **robot historian**, tracing applications of AI from a historical perspective.
- **War as a machine** integrates men, tools, and weapons.

## Areas of War Affected by Computers
- **Cruise missiles**
- **Radar systems**
- **Control, command, and communication networks**
- **War games**
- **Numerical control and logistics systems**

### Military Institutions as Machines
- Composed of several levels, integral since antiquity:
  1. **Weapons and hardware**
  2. **Tactics**: Integration of men and weapons into formations.
  3. **Strategy**: Political goals achieved through coordinated battles.
  4. **Logistics**: Procurement and supply networks.

- Advances in computer technology have reciprocally impacted military systems and civilian sectors, as seen in **operations research** evolving into **management science** and **systems analysis**.

---

## Self-Organisation and Emergent Order
- Computers facilitate the study of **self-organising processes** in nature.
  - Example: Atoms in a metal cooperate to produce magnetism.

- Examples of emergent behavior:
  - **War onset** modeled mathematically, akin to turbulence in fluids.
  - **Local intelligence** in computer networks enables message routing without central controllers.

## Chapter 1: Collision Course
### Methods of Waging War
- **Nomadic War Machines** (e.g., Genghis Khan)
- **Sedentary War Machines** (e.g., Greeks & Romans)
  - Modern armies evolved from sedentary systems.

- **1494 Turning Point**:
  - Introduction of the **mobile cannon** shifted power to sedentary armies.
  - Integration of artillery necessitated new military architecture.

### Evolution of Tactics
- From tight formations to **flexible, decentralized units** capable of local initiative.
- Chaos theory highlights **turbulence effects** on weapons systems (e.g., air drag on projectiles, water drag on submarines).

---

## Scientific and Technological Insights
- **Critical Points**: Order emerges from chaos at specific thresholds.
  - Examples: Urban mass size, political power distribution, triggering fission.

- **Arthur Iberall's Model**:
  - Societies as ensembles of fluxes and reservoirs (water, energy, population, trade, technology).

- **Firearm Evolution**:
  - Early firearms (e.g., hand cannons) lacked mechanisms for guidance and control.
  - Simplified dynamic models enabled engineers to study trajectories by ignoring drag and friction.

---

## Military Hardware and Software
- Development of **radar curtains** led to advancements like the bomber plane and radar evasion tactics.
- Importance of **software** (human element) over hardware.

---

## Concepts in Military Organisation
- **Friction**: Breakdown and delays in transport and communication networks; broader interference with plans.
- **Centralisation Problems**:
  - Excessive detail in commands increases uncertainty.
  - Mission-oriented, decentralized tactics grant units autonomy to achieve defined goals.

- Soldiers were trained to **fear officers** more than the enemy to maintain cohesion in hierarchical systems.

---

## Key Comparisons
- **Clockwork vs. Motors**:
  - Clockwork relies on external sources of motion.
  - Motors generate their own.
