# Poll Tax

- A replacement of "rates," now replaced by "council tax."
- Prior to poll tax, the spending of British local authorities was funded from three main sources:
  1. **Grants** from central government.
  2. **Charges** for the use of specific services.
  3. **Property tax** = "rates" based on the value of individual properties.

- Poll tax represented a **per capita tax on individuals.**

### Issues Identified

- **Ex-ante awareness:** Civil servants were aware of the administrative difficulties and high costs associated with the introduction of such a tax.
- **Lack of local government support:** Many local governments refused to implement poll tax, with some passing arguably illegal budgets.
- **Exclusion of outsiders:** The review process lacked external input.
- **Regressive taxation:** Poll tax was explicitly regressive.
- **Collection challenges:** Many people refused to pay, making collection expensive and tedious.

### Takeaways

1. **Communication gaps:** Poor communication between execution and authority layers.
2. **Separation of roles:** Those proposing the tax changes were unaware of practical constraints/limitations faced by implementers.
3. **Poor review process:** Not all relevant stakeholders were involved.
4. **Lack of piloting:** Implementation was rushed and rolled out wholesale.
5. **Ignored concerns:** Practical concerns about implementation were not addressed.

# Child Support Agency (CSA)

- Between **1970 & early 1990s**, the percentage of children born to unmarried mothers rose from **~10% to ~30%.**
- This rise had **huge financial implications**:
  - As the number of unmarried mothers increased, the proportion receiving maintenance payments from their children's fathers fell from:
    - **1 in 2 (1970)** to **1 in 4 (1990).**

# Individual Learning Accounts (ILA)

- Every adult in Britain was entitled to open a learning account.  
- **First million applicants** would receive £150 if they contributed £25.  
- Large **discounts on courses** were available.  
- A variety of **tax breaks** were provided.  
- "Save-to-learn" initiative introduced.  

### Implementation

- The department was responsible for **designing the scheme**, while **Capita** was merely responsible for implementing it.
- They were expected to complete a long list of tasks within **5 months.**
- Ministers wanted a **demand-led, not supply-led scheme.**
- **Online registration and payment systems** made it easy for learners and providers to sign up.
- The system was **wide, flexible, and fast**, but very open to **fraud.**

### Issues

- **Security flaws:**  
  - Providers were given **free access** to learner accounts.  
  - Providers could arrange for the department to pay them directly from learners’ accounts without proper verification.

# IT Technology & Pathology

- A British historian argued that **Germany lost WW2** due to the chaotic way in which their armed services procured kit and weapons.  
- Governments are making **the same mistakes** with IT projects.

### Key Issues in Government IT Projects

1. **Over-reliance** on a limited number of suppliers.
2. **Ignorance** across departments regarding their own IT-related activities.
3. **Obsolescence:** Government-developed IT systems are often **outdated pre-implementation.**

# Tube (London Underground Public-Private Partnership)

- One of the **least publicized megaproject failures** in the UK, wasting an estimated **£25bn.**  

### Background

- The **London Underground** was in a bad state, and both parties agreed something needed to be done.
- The **Conservatives** suggested **privatization**, while **New Labour** proposed a **Public-Private Partnership (PPP).**
- PPP was motivated by:
  - The practical belief in **superior private sector efficiency.**
  - The political belief that privatization was not the answer.
- PPP was an approach that meant **anything short of wholesale privatization.**

### Perspectives

- The private sector was assumed to be **more efficient**, but:
  - Labour could not be seen as privatizing national services.
  - The objective was to balance the benefits of privatization without negative PR implications.

### Issues Identified

1. **Misalignment of goals:**  
   - The teleology of the approach wasn’t clear.
2. **Cost overruns:**  
   - Endemic to large construction projects.
3. **Cascading failures:**  
   - The scope of the project was too broad and complex for government departments to manage effectively.
4. **Lack of precedent:**  
   - The scale and complexity of the project were unprecedented.
5. **Conflicting incentives:**  
   - Misalignment between advisory services (e.g., consultants) and the government:
    - **3rd party firms** aimed to maximize rent by generating **more work for themselves.**
