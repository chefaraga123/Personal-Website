When I started Footium I posited the idea that Footium clubs or players shall go for as much as a real club or a real player, and the management of Footium clubs as a basis on which to judge real world clubs. The implication of that being true is that Footium as a world would have a similar type of existence to real world football.

Given some awareness of the Autonomous Worlds meme that has developed over the last couple years. The thesis is that blockchains are the best substrate for world building. Blockchain state unambiguously holds the world’s history, and the state transition function is the world’s ruleset for what can become true. The essential point being that a blockchain as a container has a similar ontological interpretation to the real world.

Considering Autonomous Worlds through the lens of Baudrillard’s idea of hyperreality, whereby representations of reality become more real, more canon, than the underlying reality. The trend in 20th and 21st century media has been the dissolution of the boundary between the real and the abstract, and even the subordination of the real by the abstract.  

Football is already hyperreal. Most consumption of the sport is digitally mediated, with reflexive narratives emerging that break from what is actually happening on the pitch. Fans' judgments of player performances, for example, reflect socially constructed narratives rather than objective realities.

Thinking of football as a world system, the central institution is the operation of matches, this is the real of the sport. This real is only a small part of football the world. The cultural side of football, its second order effect, is much larger than the centre, this real centre benefits and is sustained by the periphery institutions that maintain and drive attention and value.

This reflection generates a few interesting conclusions: (1) supporting institutions need to be able to emerge in order for the core to be valuable, (2) football and its fandom is already hyperreal.

The implication of (1)  is that for Footium to win, and be as significant, as rich, as real world football, periphery institutions need to emerge.

The implication of (2) is that the social context has already been prepared for a digitally native football world.

The way that we facilitate (1):

Footium operates the simulations, it defines the economic ruleset. It provides the foundations for this world. Going on-chain means that the simulation can directly form the basis of on-chain derivative content (straightforward to build fantasy Footium, wagering etc… once the simulation is pushed on-chain.). Now periphery institutions can emerge, owned by anyone.

Generative-AI means that tooling exists to populate this world for trivial cost, Footium could rapidly grow a cultural footprint.

The way that we facilitate (2):

Decentralised club ownership means that the number of people that can experience owning a football club, and directly participate in the world of football is far greater. Footium is Direct Democracy x Football.

Footium can use an IP framework that empowers derivative content creators, Storygraph is a nascent instance of emerging frameworks. Footium can be a far better economic vehicle for football fans more generally, they can commercialise their club & efforts. They can’t commercialise their fandom.
