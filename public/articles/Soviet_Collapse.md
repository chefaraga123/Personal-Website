How Gorbachev’s reforms collapsed the Soviet Union 
The chain of events that ultimately lead to the collapse of the Soviet Union can be tied to the ascendancy of Gorbachev. Although one can say that the collapse of the Soviet Union was inevitable due to intrinsic issues with the command economy system, its collapse at a particular point in time depends on contingencies propelled by the path driven forward by Gorbachev. 

Gorbachev became General Secretary of the USSR in 1985, a neo-Leninist, Gorbachev held a view of Lenin as a genius whose power was undergirded by a lofty theoretical basis rather than thuggish Stalinist terror. This Leninism motivated Gorbachev with the spirit of supranational world revolution rather than purely domestic reform.

Andropov, Gorbachev’s predecessor, considered pressing issues regarding the USSR’s macroeconomic stability. The key issue was the USSR’s balance of payments which had deteriorated with rising food imports and the over-reliance on oil exports. 

Gorbachev sought to shape policy with an underappreciation of the system-level effects. 

The set of policies pushed in the struggle against binge drinking undermined the economy. The tax on alcohol procured a third of Soviet GDP and 

Industrial production by Soviet enterprises was measured in tons and number, rather than sales figures, this exemplary of Goodhart’s law with hilarious side effects such as the production by shoe factories of only left-shoes and pervasive poor quality amongst manufactured goods. The creation of an inspection process to curtail the worst of this system rapidly incurred massive lossage, although this was well-intentioned, the cascade along supply chains froze domestic production. Reeling from this the old system was restored, absent improvement, having incurred the losses. 

During 1986 world oil prices rapidly declined from $27 per barrel, to $10 per barrel.

The Chernobyl disaster which occurred in 1986, beyond the massive expense of dealing with this situation, was leveraged as a Casus Belli by Gorbachev to rush through grand sweeping reforms that broke with the conservative approach to action.   

The reforms were intended to move power from the ossified bureaucracy to the grassroots, state enterprises and working collectives. The party had to become an engine of revolutionary change. 

A key reform was the law on socialist enterprises. This was the consummate product of reform-minded economists who sought to combine socialism with a state regulated market. This contradicted the 1917 revolutionary approach of property whereby the state was the custodian of all property. 

In the soviet union there were two kinds of money in circulation. One currency was virtual called безналичный which means non-cash - this virtual accounting system was between the state and state enterprises. This type of money resembled issue bills and letters of credit in the market economy with the caveat that they could never be cashed. 
The second kind of money was Наличные, which means cash, this was the type of money used to pay wages, and purchases goods and services. 

This mechanism allowed the state to finance massive projects without inflating the nominal price of consumer goods and services.

Cash did exist in people’s hands with the potential to create inflation and macroeconomic instability. 

The partition between these two modes of money was watertight, all enterprises had to have double bookkeeping. There were forbidden to use their non-cash allocations for salaries and wages, and they couldn’t purchase industrial equipment and raw materials with cash.
