# Managerial Ethics & Ethical Micro-Management
## Introduction
Organisation of human affairs seems to follow a consistent pattern in different domains

This is a systems-theory article - seeking to understand the general structure of various modes of human organisation. 

This follows incentives in organisation, both from the perspective of legal incentives, and from the perspective of organisational command and control, which are in many ways closely related as they both relate to the adherence of the members of some organisation, although of different scales, to rules and objectives set out therein. 

Is this isomorphic to consequentialism vs a deontological ethical framework. 

## Managerial ethics 
### Toyota: Micro-Manage the Process
The Toyota Production Company is famous for its input-oriented nature, the Key Concepts of TPS relate to adherence to a production process, the assumption being that the process is good, and satisfaction of the process maps 1:1 onto a desired result. At the meta-layer, the judgement encapsulated in the correspondence between input and output occurs in the architecture of the process by the managerial group, or the higher order structure. 

Here higher-order structure is the definition of the process

Obviously, Kaizen, the process is always being improved, but in a 

So in Toyota, 
### Micro-Manage adherence to results 
The opposite of the Toyota Production System is if employees, or managers, have complete autonomy to decide how they work in order to hit an objective - however the objective itself is non-neogitable and output is very specifically measured against that objective. This is the story told by Ricard Semler who evangelises his mode of management at SemCo, one of Brazil’s most successful manufacturing companies - although it remain private and didn’t realise the sheer scale of success TPS, it helps cohere the other side of the the managerial dipole. 



## Legal ethics 
### Western Legal Tradition: Micro-Manage the output i.e. the impact on society 
In the Western legal tradition, actions are judged in context, i.e. what an action means is a function of its circumstance, manslaughter and murder are distinct phenomena in relation to the different types of intent. We rely on some kind of delineation between the motivation that caused or produced a phenomena and its end-result.??

Essentially, the legal system cares whether you murdered with intent, otherwise known as murder of the first degree, murder without intent, second degree, and then voluntary or involuntary manslaughter. There are extenuating circumstances that mediate the feeling, and hence proportioned punishment, of society, to what happened. Punishment is understood in proportion to the degree of perceived transgression made against society(?) - there is the higher order structure of the legal system that’s a 3rd party to all interactions. Society exists in the material world. 

From a philosophical perspective, one could denote the modern legal system as consequentialist-pragmatic, sentencing is a dual function of intent & outcome. 

One can imagine a quite different system, a system that doesn’t care about intent, and is purely outcomes based. I.e. did someone die as the result of your actions, yes or no, if yes, then you’re punished in proportion to that ultimate harm.

### Christian ethic: micro-manage the input i.e. the intent 
In the case of Christianity, the Dekalog is largely deontological in nature, actions are judged on intent. Thou Shalt Not Kill, Thou Shall Honour Thy Mother and Father…. Irrespective of your ultimate punishment for your crimes - you’re ultimately accountable to God. The presence of an omniscient God dissolves the practical problems of Cartesian certainty. 

And in some respects, in a religious society, there are two parallel legal systems, a deontological ethic represented by religion, and a consequentialist-pragmatic one represented by the legal system of man. 

### Chinese Imperial Law: micro-manage the output i.e. transgression against the output

Psychiatry belies adherence to Cartesian certainty, what is the difference between the behaviour and the simulation, or feigning of that behaviour. If someone is pretending to be mad they’re mad. 


And how does that all related to 

We could reconceptualise everything in terms of inputs and outputs: inputs are equivalent to intent & motivations, and outputs are equivalent to outcomes. Different systems can have varying degrees of input or output focus i.e. what is being measured and optimised against within that system - what goes in or what goes out. 

Unification 
In the case of the ten commandments, the rules are set and success at the individual level is understood in relation to the satisfaction of those rules. 

We could imagine a consequentialist equivalent, 
In both cases there is the assumption
