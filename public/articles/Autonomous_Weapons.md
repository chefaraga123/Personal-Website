# The weapons were always autonomous

## Introduction

The impending ubiquity of autonomous weapons is expected to radically change dynamics of war.  
War is a maximally (in)human endeavour.  
You can take the human out of the war but you can't take the war out of the human.  
Putting the ethical concerns aside, the introduction of autonomous weapons into warfare will impact the internal communications architecture of the military machine.

Borrowing from the work of Manuel Delanda, I use the word machine to foreshadow the abstract conception of the military as a tech stack composed of hardware, tactics, strategy and logistics.

To set the stage for this formulation of war as integrated machine undergirding my part 2, I'll first introduce Norbert Wiener, the prodigy who developed a weapons system we may now refer to as cybernetic, a term he coined thereafter. Subsequently, I'll explicate the role of the RAND Corporation — the organisation for the rational prosecution of war — and then discuss some of the ways in which cybernetic concepts have found their way into the Department of Defence.

In the second act I'll deploy this cybernetic ontology as a general purpose framework for understanding the evolution of the different layers in the overall stack of warfare.

There are two historical frames that I’ll use to contextualise an understanding of autonomous weapons:
- Part 1: The cybernetic origins of autonomous control in WW2 and after
- Part 2: A conceptualisation of all warfare within the framework developed in part 1
- Part 3: The implications of the contemporary trend on the architecture of the military.

## Part 1: Cybernetic Genesis

### The Birth of Cybernetics  
**Automatic Gun Control**

World War 2 was the locus of a Cambrian explosion of new techniques of warfare that set forth to change the relation of man and machine — most famously as the centre of work in computer science from which came Alan Turing's eponymous Turing test. The Turing test is often seen as a watershed moment in the thought history of automata as it is the most widely known framing of what is now referred to as Artificial Intelligence.

Not to understate the contributions of Turing, my departure point for this exploration is Norbert Wiener's development of automatic gun targeting systems. Wiener, a child prodigy who earned his PhD at age 19 for his dissertation on mathematical logic, was an early researcher into stochastic and mathematical noise processes (**brief explanation...**).

Having done some work for the military at the end of World War One. Under the direction of Warren Weaver, Wiener, a well-known mathematician at MIT, was brought into war work in 1941 on the problem of anti-aircraft gunnery control.

Wiener had worked closely with Vannevar Bush on his differential analyser (an early analog computer) who had come to head up the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD), having direct control over much of the science budget during WW2.

The problem of gun control is this — how can one accurately aim anti-aircraft guns at fast-moving enemy bomber planes? Treating the plane and the pilot as a single entity, Wiener approached automatic gun control as a problem of prediction under uncertainty. He built a system that took in data, processed it, and hence adjusted its aim to match the aircraft’s expected future position. This was a type of negative feedback system — it continuously compared the plane’s predicted trajectory to what actually happened, using the difference to correct itself, honing in on the target with each update.

Practically, the gun control mechanism had four key components:
- A **sensor**, the then recently invented radar which provided real-time data on the target’s location
- A **processor** which was an analog computer, taking in the input from the radar and then calculating predictions of the future position
- An **actuator**: a servo mechanism that translated the processor’s output into precise mechanical motion, continuously adjusting the gun’s position based on feedback to align with the predicted target trajectory
- A **human operator** to oversee the operation

While it required human approval to fire weapons, it automated the detection → decision → action chain which is the crux of the cybernetic loop. This metamorphosis from the human as executor to human as supervisor was significant for the ontology of war, something had changed radically forever.

Weiner’s major conceptual leap had been to recognise that the system formed a closed-loop feedback circuit: data was continuously processed, and used to adjust behaviour in real time - and this feedback could be automated. 

It was the result of this insight that Weiner coined the field of cybernetics as ”the science of control and communications in the animal and machine”. 

In reality the operational impact of this gun control system was modest and  the practical extent of the gun’s autonomy and the human role as supervisor was little like what we could see now it is similar in kind. The gun control experiment set the frame that the machine could take over routine cognitive tasks like prediction and response. 

Weiner held deep reservations about the risk of removing humans from the decision making processes, fearing that over-delegating to machines could remove moral responsibility & critical judgement. He wanted to maintain man-in-the-loop control. Paul Scharre - who helped draft DoD policy on autonomy depicts the trajectory in three ways:  
- Human in the loop - direct human control 
- Human on the loop - human oversight over automated systems 
- Human out of the loop - full autonomy with no human intervention 

### RAND Corporation

The RAND Corporation was established in 1948, with the vague original mandate:  
> “A program of study and research on the broad subject of intercontinental warfare other than surface, with the objective of recommending to the Army Air Forces preferred techniques and instrumentalities for this purpose.”

RAND was the centre of the milieu that inspired Stanley Kubrick's dark comedy Doctor Strangelove or: How I learned to stop worrying and love the bomb, showcasing the paranoia and absurdity of game theoretic approaches to war. The film portrays how,  in order to sustain the credible threat of retaliation against the United States in the event of nuclear war, the USSR creates a Doomsday device that cannot be turned off that will automatically respond to a first strike. An ironic crux of the film being how it cannot be turned off.   
The people working at RAND, a mixture of military theorists, mathematicians like von Neumann, and technocrats sought to create a new model of military rationality one based not on heroism but on strategic logic, game theory, and theoretical models of decision-making under uncertainty.

This approach to war depended on treating human and machine actors as functionally interchangeable components in a system, a conception of war within the frame of Norbert Wiener's Cybernetics which had ontologically flattened man and machine by seeing them both in terms of feedback, communication and control. 

Seeing war as a command and control loop, lead to human decision-makers being increasingly treated like nodes in a network — agents with bounded rationality, whose behavior could be optimized, simulated, or replaced. This framing undergirded the shift towards seeing war as quantitative business, as Robert McNamara infamously did during the Vietnam War - trying to measure success in terms of linear metrics that diverged from the holistic reality. Whilst McNamara hasn’t been judged favourably by history, the integration of rationality into war through computers has only progressed. 

### Strategic Computing at DARPA 

### Recap
The purpose of this section has been to suggest that the cultural & practical emergence of autonomous weapons began during World War Two, with Norbert Wiener’s automatic gunner control project. The creation of a closed circuit was a watershed moment, which, combined with the intellectual development of game theory metamorphosed war into a rational system in which people - as predictable agents - were interchangeable with machines - a world in which the distinction between autonomous weapons and “subordinated” weapons is dissolved. .

## Part 2: Cybernetic Ontology


### The Military Machine 
Manuel De Landa writes about the notion of war / the military institution as a kind of integrated machine is not novel. 

The level of weapons and the hardware of war 
The level of tactics, in which men and weapons are integrated into formations
The level of strategy in which the battles fought by those formations acquire a unified political goal 
The level of logistics, of procurement, and supply network
