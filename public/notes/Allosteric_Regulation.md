# Allosteric Regulation
The word allostery was coined to refer to how a *protein’s interaction with one molecule can affect that with another*. For example an enzyme that transforms binding partner/ligandA might be inactive until it binds ligand B, whereupon it becomes able to convert A to some product P. 

It has long been known that the ability of some proteins to transform their substrate can be influenced by a 3rd party: another molecule. To "transform their substrate" means to change the shape of the protein so that it can bind to a different molecule.

## Example: Hemoglobin and Oxygen
The first evidence of this was the observation that the binding of oxygen by hemoglobin is affected by the presence of carbon dioxide. 
- Hemoglobin's primary substrate is oxygen. 
- Its functioon is to bind oxygen in the lungs and release it in the tissues. 
- Carbon dioxide acts as an alloesteric regulator that affects the binding of oxygen to hemoglobin. 
- It does this by binding to a site on the protein that is distant from the site where oxygen binds, but which has the implicaiton of affecting the ability of hemoglobin to bind oxygen. 


## G-Proteins-Coupled Receptors (GPCRs)
One of the most common examples of allosteric switching occurs in protein enzymes called **G-proteins-coupled receptors (GPCRs)** which sit embedded in cell membranes and transmit a signal that arrives from outside the cell into a response inside. They are involved in the action of [Hormones](../notes/Hormones) as well as smell, light sensitivity, and the action of neurotransmitter molecules at neural synapses 

These proteins have a binding site on the side exposed outside the cell into which the *signalling molecule such as a hormone* can dock. This induces some shape change that activates the protein on the side inside the cell, making it capable of interacting with another protein attached to the inner surface of the membrane called a G protein. The G protein is thus activated to switch on other proteins floating freely inside the cell, beginning an event cascade by means of which the signal represented by the hormone is passed along or “transduced”

Typically the *GPCR pathway activates enzymes* called **protein kinases**, which turns on other enzymes via chemical modification. A protein kinase takes a phosphate ion from **ATP** and transfers it to another protein. The target protein is thus said to be **phosphorylated**. 


## Glossary 
- Ligand: A molecule that binds to a protein, typically at a specific site called an active site.
