## Schema
The structure that defines how data is organised in a data base, it is a plan that describes:
- **What tables exist**
- **What columns** each table has & their data types
- **Relationships** between tables
- **Constraints & rules**: what values are allowed, required fields 
- **Indexes**: for faster data retrieval

## Table
- A table is a structure collection of data organised in rows & columns, similar to a spreadsheet.
- Its the fundamental way [[relational databases]] store information 
### Key characteristics of a table 
- **Rows**: represent a single entity or data point 
- **Columns**: represents a specific property or characteristics 
- **Cells**: the intersection of a row & column that contains a single data value
