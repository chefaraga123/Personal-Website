Points of departure for a general systems theory
- **Models that work with the concept of equilibrium or balance**
	- This development is characterised by the distinction between a stable state and a disturbance 
	- One imagines an equilibrium to be something stable that only reacts to disturbances & reacts in such a way that the original equilibrium is re-established or a new state of equilibrium is reached 
	- This viewpoint coincides with the perspective that theories of equilibrium are theories of stability 
- The extension to this..
	- that the idea of equilibrium can be understood as a theory that marks and locates a system's sensitivity to disturbance.
	- A theory underpinned by the concept of equilibrium is typically concerned with finding out how the relation between disturbance and stability can be increased in such a manner that a system, even if perturbed is still stable 
	- Classical and neo-classical [[Economics]] are predominantly concerned with the prevailing forces by which an economy returns to equilibrium 
- This lead to the thought that perhaps the opposite is true 
	- that imbalance/disequilibrium is the condition of stability. 
- Novel issue arose from [[thermodynamics]], i.e. how systems can be maintained if one must assume that physics (at least the physics of [[closed systems]]) tend to produce [[entropy]]. How can [[negentroy]] be explained as a deviation from entropy.
- The notion of closed system was rejected in biology & sociology, and instead a theory of [[open systems]] was developed
