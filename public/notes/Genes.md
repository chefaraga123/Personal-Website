# Genes  

In popular discourse, genes are often seen as the **essence of being**, with the idea that there is a direct correspondence between particular **behaviors** and particular **genes**.  

Following the discovery of the **double-helix DNA** structure in 1953, there was a prevailing belief that **everything** about a person—including their complete development process—could be derived from their genes.  

## Historical Context  

### Darwin and Pangenesis  
Charles Darwin proposed that traits are inherited through a process called **pangenesis**, where cells in the body would deliver information via the reproductive organs into offspring.  
- The term **"gene"** is derived from the word *pangenesis*.  

### Mendel’s Experiments  
Gregor **Mendel**, conducting **plant-breeding experiments** in the 1860s, crossbred plants to observe how characteristics were inherited.  

- He found that inheritance followed **discrete** patterns, rather than blending traits from parents.  
- This led to the distinction between **dominant** and **recessive** traits:  
  - **Dominant**: Manifests if inherited from one parent.  
  - **Recessive**: Only appears if inherited from both parents.  
- **Key takeaway**: Traits are inherited **unchanged & unmixed**.  
- Mendel was primarily focused on **breeding**, not **evolution**.  

## Modern Understanding of Genes  

Mendel’s observations, through a modern lens, imply that **trait-determining genes** come in different varieties, called **alleles**.  

- **Alleles** are different versions of the same gene.  
- For each gene, an individual inherits **one allele from the father & one from the mother**.  

### Chromosomes and Molecular Genetics  
The question arose: **What were these "gene particles"?**  

- **Chromosomes** (*"colored bodies"*) were strong candidates for being the material component of genes.  
- **Human somatic cells** contain **46 chromosomes** (two copies of 23 different varieties).  
- **Gametes** (sperm and egg cells) contain **only one set** of chromosomes (**haploid**), unlike **diploid** somatic cells.  

This led to the question: **What are chromosomes?**  
- A **protein** and another molecule: **DNA**.  
- **DNA** is a **polymer** of four types of **chemical units** (**nucleotides**), distinguished by their **bases**.  

Genes were understood to be **a kind of molecule**, marking the birth of **molecular genetics**.  

## What Do Genes Really Do?  

Proteins are made from **amino acids** joined together in a **chain** that forms a **specific shape**.  

- The **shape** and **chemical behavior** of a protein depend on the **sequence** of its amino acids.  
- There are **20 varieties** of amino acids in natural proteins.  

### The Genetic Code: Transcription & Translation  
Genetic information is transferred in two key steps:  

1. **Transcription**  
   - DNA information is **copied** into an **RNA molecule** (messenger RNA or **mRNA**).  
   - This process is carried out by the enzyme **RNA polymerase**.  

2. **Translation**  
   - The **mRNA** is used to **make a protein**.  

The simplest assumption was that **DNA base pairs** correspond directly to **amino acids** in a protein.  

- **Four types of DNA bases**, but **20 naturally occurring amino acids**.  
- The **genetic code** was fully cracked in **1967**, revealing that **triplets of base pairs** correspond to specific **amino acids** in proteins.  

### DNA Packaging in Chromatin  
Inside the **cell nucleus**, DNA is packaged in a **substance called chromatin**:  

- A **filamentary assembly** of **DNA & proteins**.  
- Only **short stretches** of the **naked DNA helix** are exposed.  
- The **arrangement of DNA within chromatin** is central to **replication & transcription**.  

## Shifting Perspectives on Gene Function  

In the **1980s and 1990s**, the prevailing view was that:  

- The **activation (expression) of a gene** to make a protein leads to **specific physiological outcomes**.  
- This implied a **direct link** between **genotype** and **phenotype**—certain **alleles** should predictably lead to certain **traits**.  

However, some **complications** arose:  

- Genes named in **one context** were sometimes later found to be **identical** to genes given **different names** in another context.  
- **Gene knockout studies**, where particular genes were selectively **disabled**, often led to **counterintuitive results**.  

## The Author’s Argument  

The author critiques **greedy reductionism** among **biologists**, particularly in the framing of **genes** as the **atomic unit of biology**.  

- The lack of reconciliation between:  
  1. The **"evolutionary gene"** that mediates inheritance.  
  2. The **"molecular gene"** that shapes an organism through development.  

This suggests that **biological complexity** cannot be reduced to **genes alone**.
