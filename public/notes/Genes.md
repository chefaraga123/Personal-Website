Genes 
In popular discourse genes are a kind of essence of being. With the popular notion that there is a correspondence between particular behaviours and particular genes. 

Following the discovery of double helix DNA in 1953 there was the perspective that everything about a person could be derived from their genes, including the complete development process. 

Charles Darwin proposed that traits are inherited through a process called pangenesis, through which cells in the body would deliver information via the reproductive organs into the offspring. Genes derive from the word pangenesis. 

Mendel was conducting plant-breeding experiments in the 1860s. Mendel crossbred plants to see what characteristics would result. He found that the results could be explained by assuming that plants inherit traits discreetly, transmitted intact & without blending.

This indicated to Mendel that traits are of two types: dominant - where inheriting from one parent will cause it to manifest in the offspring, and recessive where the trait will only appear if inherited from both parents. The key message being that traits are inherited unchanged & unmixed. 

Mendel was concerned with breeding as opposed to evolution.

Through a modern lens, Mendel’s observations imply that trait-determining genes come in different varieties, called alleles. For each gene, you get one allele from your father & one from your mother.  Alleles are different versions of the same gene. 

What were these ‘gene particles’?
Chromosomes (“coloured bodies”) were a strong candidate for the material component of genes. 
Human somatic cells contain 46 chromosomes: two copies of each of 23 different varieties. 
The gametes are special insofar they each contain only one set of chromosomes. This makes them haploid cells - as opposed to the diploid somatic cells. 

This begs the question as to what are chromosomes - a protein & another molecule (DNA)DNA is a polymer of 4 types of chemical unit (nucleotides), these nucleotides being distinguished by their bases. 

Genes were a kind of molecule - the field of molecular genetics ws born. 

There was never a proper reconciliation of the “evolutionary gene” that mediates inheritance and the molecular gene that acts somehow in cells to shape an organism through development. 

What do genes really do? Proteins are made from amino acids joined together in a chain that forms a specific shape. This shape and the chemical behaviour of the protein depend on the sequence of amino acids - of which there are 20 varieties in natural proteins. 

Genetic information is first transferred to an RNA molecule (called messenger RNA, hence mRNA) in a process called transcription, and the mRNA is then used to make a protein in the process of translation. Both steps rely on enzymes: RNA polymerase 

How does a gene encode a protein? The simplest assumption is that there is a correspondence between the sequence of base pairs in DNA and of amino acids in a protein. There 4 types of DNA base, but 20 naturally occurring amino acids. The project to crack the full code linking base-pair triplets to amino acids was completed in 1967. Genes encode proteins via the genetic code - a genetic sequence of bases corresponds to a particular sequence of amino acids in the product proteins. 

In the cell nucleus the DNA is packaged in a substance called chromatin - a filamentary assembly of DNA & proteins - in which only very short stretches of the naked helix are revealed. How DNA is arranged within chromatin at larger scales seems to be central to the processes or replication & transcription 

The prevailing view in the 80s/90s was that the activation (expression) of a gene to make a protein leads to some specific physiological outcomes, and there is thus a direct link between genotype and phenotype - certain alleles should lead predictably to certain traits. 

However genes awarded names in one context sometimes turned out to be identical to genes given different names in another context. 

Many studies of gene function relied on a technology called “gene knockouts”, where particular genes were selectively disabled in an organism so that the impact could be observed.However the results were often counter intuitive. 

The author seems to be arguing against a greedy reductionist ontology amongst biologists - in the context of “genes” being framed as the atomic unit of biology
