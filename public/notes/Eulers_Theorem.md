- The assertion that for a [[Polyhedron]]:
	- $v - e + f = 2$
	- Where 
		- $v = no. Vertices$
		- $e = no. Edges$
		- $f = no. Faces$


- Let $P$ be a polyhedron which satisfies: 
- Hypothesis a) Any two vertices of $P$ can be connected by a chain of edges
- Hypothesis b) Any loop on $P$ which is made up of straight line segments separates $P$ into two pieces
- Then $v - e + f = 2$ for $P$

Proving Euler's Theorem 

A connected set of vertices and edges of $P$ will be called a [[graph]]

A [[graph]] which doesn't contain any loops we call a ***tree***. In a graph, the number of vertices minus the number of edges equals 1: $v(T) - e(T) = 1$. 

The set of all vertices and edges of $P$ is a [[graph]], in any graph one can trivially find a subgraph which is a tree 

### [[Homeomorphic]] polyhedra have the same Euler's number 
- When calculating the Euler's number for a space we make use of the numbers of vertices, edges and faces of the polyhedron - none of which are preserved under [[Topological Equivalence]]
