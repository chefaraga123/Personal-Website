- [[topology]]
- [[topological space]]
- Also known as **homeomorphism**
- Two spaces are considered homeomorphic if there exists a [[bijective function]] (a function that is both injective and surjective) between them and its inverse, both of which are continuous. A homeomorphism preserves all topological properties of the spaces involved. 

### Examples of [[homeomorphic]] spaces: 
a) the surface of a cylinder of finite height, excluding the two circles at the end
b) the one-sheeted [[hyperboloid]] given by the equation: $x^2 + y^2 -z^2 =1$ 
c) the open [[annulus]] in the complex plane specified by $1<|z|<3$
d) the sphere with the points at the north and south poles removed **

Providing a specific ***homeomorphism*** from **space b) to space c)**
Specify the points of b) by [[cylindical polar coordinates]] and [[plane polar coordinates]] for the points of c) 

Topological equivalence is an equivalence relation, hence to show that all spaces from a) to d) are equivalent, it suffices to prove only against a single space, such as c). In topology these four spaces are considered to be the same space.
