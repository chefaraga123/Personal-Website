### Open and Closed Sets
Most simply:
**If all the boundary points are included in the set, then its a closed set.** 
**For example**: the interval $[4,7]$ is closed because its complement consists of the two open sets $(-\infinity, 4)$ 

If all the boundary points are not included in the set then it is an open set**

Let $X$ be a [[topological space]] and call a subset $O$ of $X$ *open* if it is a neighbourhood of each of its points. 
The union of any collection of open sets is open according to the axioms defining a topological space 
The intersection of any finite number of open sets is open according to the same set of axioms 

In other words: 
A set $U \subset R$ is called open. If for each $x \in U$ there exists a $\epsilon >0$ s.t. that the interval $(x-\epsilon, x+\epsilon)$ is contained in U.. Such an interval is often called a neighbourhood of $x$
A set $F$ is closed if the complemeent of $F$ is open
