Reality is a self-contained form of language. Reality conforms to the algebraic definition of a language.

Reality incorporates:
- representations of object-like individuals, space-like relations and attributes and time-like functions and operations 
- a set of expressions or perceptual states 
- a syntax consisting of (a) logical & geometric rules of structure and (b) an inductive-deductive generative grammar identifiable with the laws of state-transition 

*whereof that which cannot be linguistically described, one cannot perceive or conceive*

That which is non-isomorphic to language is beyond consideration as a component of reality. 

Reality Principle: Reality contains all and only that which is real. 

The predicate *reality* is primarily a linguistic construct confirming to a syntactic structure, where *syntax* consists of the rules byy which predicates are constructed and interpreted. 

Reality amounts to a kind of theory in whose axioms & rules of inference are implicitly provided by the logical component of the conceptual syntax in which it is expressed.

The principle of linguistic reducibility clarifies the issue as to whether ***reality is a linguistic predicate*** or the ***objective content of such a predictate*** by asserting that it is both. 

Perception is a sensory intersect of mind and reality, perception is possible without cognition. 

It is tautologically true that the basic language of cognition and perception is syntactically isomorphic to reality. Cognition is the process through reality everywhere recognises itself. 

In the CTMU the fundamental objects are ***syntactic operators***.  

Meaning equates to semantic connectivity and is thus linguistic in every sense of the term, the shift to a linguistic perspective is indispensable for teleology. .
