- a theory of Evolution that precedes Darwin's **[Theory of Evolution](../notes/Theory_of_Evolution)**
- The key idea is that improvements acquired by an organism during its lifetime can be inherited by its offspring. 
- Lamarck proposed that improvements were driven by a tendency, built into the laws of nature towards ever greater complexity 
- This theory effectively just invokes ideas equivalent to the **[Spontaneous Generation of organisms](../notes/Spontaneous_Generation_of_organisms)**
- the fundamental error of Lamarckism has the same logic as **[induction](../notes/induction)**/inductivism. Both assume that new knowledge (adaptations & scientific theories) are somehow already present in experience, or can be mechanically derived from experience. 
- Knowledge must be first conjectured and then tested.
- Darwin's theory says: first random mutations occur, then natural selection discards the variant genes of lower **[fitness](../notes/fitness)**
