Polyhedrons are 3-D Geometric figures composed of flat surfaces called faces - these faces are [[polygons]]
The line segment where two faces meet are called edges, these edges are the edges of the polygons. The points where three or more edges meet are called vertices. 

Polyhedrons are of two types 

### [[Convex]] Polyhedorn
- 

### Non-[[Convex]] Polyhedron
