- This is not titled [[Information Economics]], as this is not about the subfield within [[Economics]], it is about how the concept of *information* found its way into the economics discipline 

As explored by **[[Jacob Marshack]]**, [[modalities of information in neoclassical theory]]:
- **Shannon Information** 
- **Blackwell Formalism** - suggested an instrument reading was more informative if it could distinguish observations over a finer partition of the state space of possibilities.
	- [[Information theory as a theory of difference]]?
- Transaction costs as information 

[[Leonard Hurwicz]] was another early contributor at the intersection of information theory and economics, and one of the early progenitors of [[mechanism design]]
