[[scientific reductionists]]

Scientific reductionism is directly concerned with the ontological structure of nature.
Unlike the [[philosophical reductionists]] which are fixated on identities, the scientific reductionist accepts the role of compositional concepts in explanations in the sciences.

Driving the scientific reductionist is the argument that *compositional concepts* ground arguments establish how ***wholes are nothing more than their parts*** and establish ***compositional reductions*** in our ontological commitments. 

- *essentially by stating **wholes are nothing more than their parts** we are saying the **whole is entirely explicable in terms of its parts***
- ***to establish a reduction** is to demonstrate that higher-order phenomena can be fully explained by lower-level components *


The scientific reductionist still **accepts a macro-world** and the **indispensability of higher science** for the expression of their corresponding truths. This is a very different position from the [[Semantic model of reduction]] posited by philosophy.

The scientific reductionist accepts a "[[Collectivist Ontology]]"
