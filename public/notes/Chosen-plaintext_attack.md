- **What is it:**
	- a model for cryptanalysis which assumes that the attacker can obtain the ciphertexts for arbitrary plaintexts of their choosing. The goal of the attacker under this model is to uncover the secret key used for encryption or breach the confidentiality of messages that were not chosen by the attacker 

- **How it Works** 
	- The **attacker** chooses various **plaintexts** which they expect, when encrypted will reveal useful information about the encryption algorithm or key. 

- What this is important: 

- Why this is an important attack to consider for an encryption scheme:
