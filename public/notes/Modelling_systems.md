- When one is attempting to model the dynamical behaviour of some object, the first step is to determine the number of relevant ways in which such an object can change and then to relate. 
- Each way in which the object can change is a dimension
	- referring to any variable that defines the state of the system. 
- Then we can thus model our physical object in abstract space. This abstract space is known as *state space* or *phase space*, or most generically  points in this space corresponding to a particular state of the system.
- The concept of a dimension need not take on a physical interpretation. 
	
#### Theory of dynamical systems
- In dynamical systems, the dimensions of the manifold are used to represent properties of a particular physical process or [[System]], whiles the manifold itself becomes the space of possible states which the physical system can have 
- Manifolds are connected to material reality by their use as models of physical processes 
- When one attempts to model the dynamical behaviour of a particular physical object, the first step is to ***determine the number of relevant ways in which such an object can change - known as degrees of freedom and then to relate those changes to one another using differential calculus ***.


#### Example: Modelling a Pendulum
- A pendulum can only change its position and momentum, so it has **two-degrees of freedom***
- A pendulum can indeed be melted down etc... but this is not relevant from the perspective of dynamics. 

#### Example: Modelling a Bicycle
- A bicycle, if we consider its moving part (handle bars, front-wheel, rear-wheel, assembly, two wheels), has ten moving parts (***and ten degrees of freedom***, momentum and position for each component 
- 
#### Example: modelling a moving car, 
- The independent variables that define the state of the car may include its position in space, its speed and its acceleration. 
- Each of these variables map to a dimension in the *abstract space* of possible states of the car.

#### Bringing it together 
- Our Pendulum can be represented in a 2-dimensional plane, to represent our bicycle we need a 10-dimensional space. 
- After the mapping operation the state of the object at any given instant in time becomes a single point in the manifold - which we call [[topological space]] 
- The state space doesn't capture the static properties - but the processes at some point in time. Resources from [[topology]] can be brought to analyse features of these spaces, and the recurrent/typical behaviour typical to these spaces
