In SQL, tables are the fundamental structures that store data in a relational database. 
A table consists of rows & columns, where:
- **Columns** define the structure of the data (like fields, or attributes)
- **Rows** represent individual records or data entries. 

You can perform various operations on tables using SQL commands
