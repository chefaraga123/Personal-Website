- UK Strategic direction has went through three phases since WW2
- **During the cold war** prevention of war with the USSR through deterrence was the cornerstone of UK grand strategy, acknowledged for the first time by **[Winston Churchill](../notes/Winston_Churchill)** in **1955**
- In 1991 the USSR collapsed, and it was only in **1997 that explicit new strategic direction** was **introduced** under **[Tony Blair](../notes/Tony_Blair)**, who unveiled a doctrine of intervention, resulting in the increased use of UK military capability during the Blair administration, notably Kosovo (1999), Sierra Leone (2000), Afghanistan (2001), Iraq (2003).
- In **2010** the Conservative/LibDem coalition shifted policy from an interventionist one, to a policy of conflict prevention.  
-------------------
- After the cold war general discourse about defence strategy increased considerably, perspectives diverged between beliefs in the need to maintain capabilities, and belief that given national security additional capabilities were a matter of national discretion 
- *the end of the Cold War had transformed the state of world affairs, but nobody was quite sure how*

- Developing a national strategy now, is more difficult than during the Cold War, or Early Expeditionary Periods.
