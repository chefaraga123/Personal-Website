# Overview

Contracts for difference (CfD) are part of a **broader electricity market reform strategy**, which established: contracts for difference, the carbon price floor, the emissions performance standard, a capacity market. 

CfD intends to stabilize the prices received by low carbon generation in order to support investment.  

This is done by paying the generator the difference between a measure of the cost of investing in a particular low-carbon technology which is denoted the strike price and a measure of the average market price for electricity denoted the reference price. 

Payment to the generator = the strike price - the reference price. 

When the reference price > the strike price, the generator makes a payment to the market operator. 

This is a mechanism by which renewables benefit from a direct subsidy. 


# CfD allocation

CfDs are allocated by a reverse auction. In a reverse auction, the lowest bidder gets the contract. 

Producers for each type of low-carbon technology submit a bid containing a strike price. 

There is a total allocation for each type of low-carbon technology. 

The CfD contracts are allocated to the lowest bidding producers until the total allocation is exhausted.

Then the strike price is set to the highest bid inside the allocation (i.e. the marginal bid).
