- Having considered, **[Technical Machines](../notes/Technical_Machines)**, we can move onto consider the proposed distinction between trivial and non-trivial machines. 
- **Trivial machines** are characterised by the fact that the input is transformed into output according to a specific rule, so that given certain inputs there are certain results 
- **Non-Trivial machines** always interpose their own state and pose questions in between and only then do they produce output. A self-referential loop is built in.

--------------------------------------------------------
- Trivial machines function reliably and in daily life we depend on taking for granted the reliable action of others.
