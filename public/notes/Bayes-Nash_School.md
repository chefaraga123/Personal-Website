*when thinking of market design, the first thing that is likely to come to mind is the efforts of game theorists to theorise the incentive properties of various auction forms*

The historical origin of this school is with [[William Vickrey]], the namesake of the eponymous Vickrey auction. 

Vickrey explored the incentive properties of four auction types- ***the first-price and second-price sealed bid, the English and the Dutch auctions***. Doing so using [[Nash game theory]]. 

Given Vickrey's version of epistemology it was no longer possible to hold tight on private information, given an analyst could generate a method to extract that information.  To do so would require using an ***incentive compatible auction***.
