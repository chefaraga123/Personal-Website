- Arrow strikes at the heart of public choice 

- 5 axioms for a good social decision rule 
	- The rule should define a group's preferences only in terms of the preferences of that group's members 
	- The rule must not designate a single individual's preferences as representative of the group 'Non-dictatorship condition'
	- If the group's members are unanimous the rule must deem the group to have those preferences too 
	- Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives

- Voting system can never simultaneously satisfy all desirable criteria:
	- Non-dictatorship
	- Pareto Efficiency
	- Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives 

- Arrow proved these rules' logical inconsistency
- Those axioms that seem necessary for a rational decision rule are inconsistent/irrational -> hence its proposed we shall necessarily fail if a rational decision rule is our objective
