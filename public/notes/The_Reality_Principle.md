The reality concept is self-contained, containing all and only that which is real. 

This characterisation of reality is indeed circular this circularity is essential to the reality concept. 

This circularity does not preclude a perceptual basis. 

***Reality is the perceptual aggregate including: (1) all scientific observations (understood atemporally), (2) the entire abstract and/or cognitive explanatory infrastructure of perception***

By identifying reality as self-contained this endows the theory with a simple kind of closure. 

Everywhere reality is self-contained, it is everywhere the same as itself - **what about its internal distinctions?**
