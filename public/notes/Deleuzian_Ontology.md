Within Deleuzian [[Ontology]], a species is not defined by its *essential traits* but by the *morphogenetic process* that gave rise to it.


A central concept within Deleuzian Ontology is the idea of the [[Deleuzian multiplicity]], which represents the replacement to the [[philosophical concept of the essence]]. Within an essentialist philosophy defines a set in terms of its characteristics - whereas a Deleuzian approach defines a species by the process that gave rise to it. 

Deleuzian ontology arises in opposition to an essentialist ontology. 
Whilst an *essential account is static, a morphogenetic account is inherently dynamic*.

An essentialists account may rely on transcedent factors, 

Essentialism is closely related to the idea of the ***[[platonic world of forms]]***. 

Deleuze's ontology represents a break from other realist ontologists' reliance on essences. 

Thinking of ***essentialism*** as a theory for the genesis of form, in other words, of *morphogenesis*

Deleuze proposes a theory of morphogenesis based on the idea of *productive differences* which drive dynamical processes. The key type of difference being [[intensive differences]]
- similar to [[Information theory as a theory of difference]]? as put forward by Niklas Luhmann

For Deleuze, the essence of objects is provided by some mathematical relation
