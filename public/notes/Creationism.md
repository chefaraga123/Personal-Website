- The idea that God/supernatural beings designed and created all biological [[Adaptations]]
- A putative designer must also have created the knowledge of how that organism works. Creation faces the inherent dilemma: is the designer a purely supernatural being - one who was "just there", complete with all that knowledge, or not. 
	- A being who was *just there* serves no explanatory purpose, and equivalent to say thing those things that exist are *just there*, with no need to attribute responsibility to a God 
	- The extent to which a creationist theory intends to elucidate on how God created said objects the most that God ceases to be supernatural and is more so an unseen entity.
