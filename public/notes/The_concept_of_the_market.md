- As mentioned by Phil Mirowski, there is little discussion of the central institution that underlines neoclassical economics - the market.. 
- [[Neoclassical Economics]] has been far more concerned with the status and nature agents than the structure and composition of markets
- Marker was sometimes treated as a general synonym for the phenomenon of exchange itself 
- Discussions of specific market mechanisms such as [[Leon Walras]]' tatonnement, or Edgeworth's recontracting process bear trivial resemblance to actual contemporary market processes
- Acknowledged differences in market structured where agents congregated would be treated as second order complications 
	- Perfect Competition vs Monopoly 
- Or collapsible to commodity definitions
	- The labour market vs the car market 
- The market in [[Neoclassical Economics]] thus took on a relatively monolithic existence.
