- Learn how to use:
	- the pipeline() for inference
	- load a pretrained model & preprocessor with an AutoClass
	- Quickly train a model with PyTorch or TensorFlow
- Download the necessary libraries:
	- `pip install transformers datasets`
		- **[transformers python library](../notes/transformers_python_library)**
		- **[datasets python library](../notes/datasets_python_library)**
	- `pip install torch`
