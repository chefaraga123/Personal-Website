- An [[RNA]] molecule can serve as a template for the creation of a copy of itself
- A population of replicators introduces a new type of [[Gradients]], a [[fitness]] gradient
- This is a gradient, because fitness differences are analogous to temperature differences. As long as differences exist they fuel a process of selection favouring the replication of one kind of a polymer over another. 
- [[Genes]] are replicators that can be interpreted as instructions in a genetic code.
