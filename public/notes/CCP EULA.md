- Interesting clauses, prima facie CCP doesn't want to reduce their users' freedom and creativity for the sake of it, instead being motivated by the constraints of real-world law

#### CLAUSE 1
#### *TERMINATION; SUSPENSION OF ACCOUNT*

*“A. By CCP for Termination of the Game*

*CCP may, in its sole discretion, cease to provide any or all of the services offered in connection with EVE (including access to the System and any or all features or components of the Game), terminate the EULA,”*

- the developer of CCP can, for any reason terminate users' access to to the game world. This seems harsh but what happens if CCP's servers hosting the game went down? Could that be construed as breaching their side of the EULA and thus expose them to liability?

#### CLAUSE 2
#### *CONDUCT*

*“B. Selling Items and Objects*

*You may not transfer, sell or auction, or buy or accept any offer to transfer, sell or auction (or offer to do any of the foregoing), any content appearing within the Game environment,”*

- This is motivated by the issues associated with RMT, they don't want to have to KYC users, or be a platform for money laundering 

#### CLAUSE 3
#### *PROPRIETARY RIGHTS*

*“C. User Content*

*User Content that you cause to be communicated to the System may not (i) violate any statute, rule, regulation or law; (ii) infringe or violate the intellectual property, proprietary, privacy or publicity rights of any third party*
…..
*CCP may take any action it deems appropriate regarding any User Content, if CCP believes, in its sole discretion, that such User Content violates the EULA or may expose CCP, its licensors and/or its suppliers to liability”*

- This section makes clear that CCP is operating within the constraints of a broader world of law and is subject to that law
