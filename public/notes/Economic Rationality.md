- [[Neoclassical Economics]] hinges around a schema of rationality composed of three components:
	- **Utility Function**: Consistent well-behaved preferences ordering reflecting the mindset of some individual.
	- **Formal Axiomatic Definitions**: The axiomatic method employed to describe mental manipulations as comprising the definition of rational choice.
	- **Methodological Individualism**: Reduction of all social phenomena to be attributed to the activities of individual agents applying (b) to (a) 

- The issue with the utility function and the existence of an inviolate preference ordering is the implication that human learning is out of scope. 
- The complex question of rationality is effectively deemed reducible to the rational choice paradigm and its exploits.
