- A method where a user (A) can proof to another user (B) that they know a value without conveying any additional information 
- The essence is to be able prove possession of knowledge without revealing it 

*Thus, the statement will always need to include that the prover knows the knowledge, but not the information itself. Meaning, you can’t say the value of z but can state that you know z. Here, z could mean anything.*

*Zero knowledge proofs don’t prove knowledge. They prove correct computation for the public output of a public algorithm without revealing the inputs to the computation.*

- **For true statements**
	- For every verifier 
	- What the verifier can compute after the interaction = what the verifier could have computed before the interaction
