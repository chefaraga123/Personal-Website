- Knowledge is a significant phenomenon in the universe at large, because to make a prediction about astrophysics, one must take a position about what types of knowledge will or will not be present near the phenomena in question

- The knowledge in human brains, and the knowledge in biological adaptations are both created by the [[Theory of Evolution]] in the broadest sense. In the case of human knowledge, variation arises through conjecture and selection by criticism and experiment. 
- In the biosphere, the variation consists of mutations in genes and natural selection favours those variants that most improve the ability of their organisms to reproduce, denoted [[fitness]]
