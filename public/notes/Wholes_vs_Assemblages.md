- [[Emergence]]
- Assemblages are wholes who properties emerge from the interaction between parts 

- when thinking about an entity composed of some parts, we may consider: *what is the relation between parts and their totalities*
- Do the parts have an existence independent of the whole, which is referred to, as *relations of interiority*, whereas if the parts have some autonomous existence then we refer to the relations as *relations of exteriority*.
