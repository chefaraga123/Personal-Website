- Hayek's ***[Road to Serfdom](../notes/Road_to_Serfdom)*** (1944) played a central intellectual role for British neoliberalism.
- The neoliberal agenda in Britain was developed by the **[Institute of Economic Affairs](../notes/Institute_of_Economic_Affairs)**, such an institution was on the fringe of British politics until the election of the 1979 Thatcher government 
- "**[Classical Liberalism](../notes/Classical_Liberalism)**"
	- Mill had made an argument defining the boundary between individual and state in his essay *On Liberty* attacking state education as despotic 
- By 1922 British politics had been recast as a contest between the **[Conservative Party](../notes/Conservative_Party)** and the **[Labour Party](../notes/Labour_Party)**, with the Liberal Party a rump  

- In this midst, the Road to Serfdom served as a political tract, not a work of economic analysis. 
- The road to serfdom Hayek argues, is a German road 
- **[Carl Schmitt](../notes/Carl_Schmitt)**'s arguments have persisted into the 21st century, because of the articulation of a problem that remains unresolved: *how can political order & liberty be secured if the state has no limit other than laws passed by whoever controls Parliament and government* Friedrick **[Hayek](../notes/Hayek)** is responding to this, but in a purely rhetorical way
- The classical liberalism promoted by Hayek in his book invoked a conception of political freedom, underpinned by a parallel, but weaker conception of economic liberty. Free markets, in the classical view were a corollary of political liberty & not the other way round 
- **What characterises neoliberalism from classical liberalism is the inversion of the relationship between politics and economics**
- Arguments for liberty became economic rather than politics, identifying the impersonality of market forces as the chief means for securing popular welfare and personal liberty.
