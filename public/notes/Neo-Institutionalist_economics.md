- A school of **[Economics](../notes/Economics)** which synthesises of economic and sociological ideas
- Rejects the atomism of neoclassical economists, and the holism of structuralist-functionalist sociologists
- Preserves methodological individualism (appropriate for a bottom-up perspective), but preserves the **[Ontology](../notes/Ontology)** Ontological holism of society, the idea that collective institutions emerge out of the interactions of individuals and have their own identity. 
- Introduces the idea of transaction costs, which reflects the imperfections in markets due to **[bounded rationality](../notes/bounded_rationality)**, **[imperfect information](../notes/imperfect_information)** and the high-enforceability costs of some contracts
