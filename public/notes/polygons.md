#### At a high-level
- A polygon is a 2-D geometric shape that is made up of straight line segments connected for form a closed shape. These line segments are called edges, and the points where they meet are known as vertices 

#### Key properties of polygons
- **Closed Shape**: A polygon is a closed shape, which means its side form a continuous loop with no gaps 
- **Straight Sides**: the sides of a polygon are straight line segments, each edge connects two vertices 
- **Vertices**: a polygon has at least three vertices 
- **Interior Angles**: the sum of the interior angles of a polygon with n sides is given by $(n-2) \times 180^\circ$
- **Exterior Angles**: The angles formed outside of the polygon at each vertex are called exterior angles, the sum of the exterior angles of any polygon is always $360^\circ$
