# RNA Transcription
Transcription refers to the process of copying the information in a gene from a DNA sequence into an intermediate molecule called a **messenger RNA (mRNA)**. 
The translation of that information into a protein is supported by the use of the **ribosome**, made of both DNA and proteins. 

Each gene is read by an enzyme called **RNA polymerase** which steps along a single unwound template strand of DNA and assembles a correspnding mRNA molecule using the same principles of base pairing that holds the double helix together. 

RNA doesnt have exactly the same base pairs as DNA: instead of thymine, it has uracil. 

Once an entire gene has been transcribed into an mRNA molecule, the mRNA detaches from the DNA making its way beyond the cell nucleus to the place where it can be converted into a protein by the ribosome. 

### Fragments 
There was the observation that the in [eukaryotic cells](../notes/eukaryotic_cells) much more RNA was transcribed than was exported out of the nucleus as mRNA to be translated by the Ribosome. Much of this so called heterogenous nuclear RNA (hnRNA) is broken down soon after it is made. Hence why does it exist?

RNA is much more than a simple mediator between gene and protein. 

Transposons: sections of the genome that can move around within the chromosomes. 

It followed that some transposons, when they moved to a different part of the chromosome, would influence the activity of genes nearby. This suggests that the genome is more than just a static repository of information. 


### Gene regulation in E.Coli
E.Coli molecules typically metabolise glucose. When they are deprived of glucose, they switch to metabolising lactose. 

This is a form of gene regulation called **allolactic regulation**. 

It would be wasteful to have all the enzymes for lactose metabolism floating around in the cell given sufficient glucose. 

The genes encoding these enzymes are equipped with swtiches that are flipped by a "repressor" protein. called Lac1 if there is no lactose around. Lac1 keeps the genes encoding lactose-metablyising enzymes switched off. 

### Non-coding RNA *(ncRNA)*
Mosst RNA is understood as the means to the end of protein synthesis. However, some RNA molecules dont encode protein molecules. When they were first observed, non coding RNA were throught to be transcriptional errors.
