#### What was the putting out system in the united states?
Also known as the ***domestic system*** or ***cottage industry***, was a pre-industrial mode of production. 
From the late 18th century -> the **1840s**, shoes were produced in homes or farms, after the turn of the century an increasing number of specialised workers received leather, thread and other supplies from a merchant or master "cordwainer". 

In the 1820s entreprneurs tried to supervise & coordinate production more effectively by setting up a central shop. Under this system shoemaking was made at individuals' own pace. 

In the 1850s capital machinery and its efficiency put an end to the putting-out system. 

As early as 1795 a continuous process flour mill was created in Delaware. 

The production of American [[pig iron]] & [[wrought iron]] was primarily concentrated in Pennsylvania.

It was only in the making of cloth that a permanent force of >50 users became common before **1840**.
