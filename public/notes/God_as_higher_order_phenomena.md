- tag **[Scientific Theories are explanations](../notes/Scientific_Theories_are_explanations)**
- Myths although false, do constitute an explanatory theory 
- However when myths are altered or superseded they are barely any closer to the truth of the situation 
- The Gods have some power to affect large-scale phenomena 
- Every detail of the myth, i.e. its internal mechanics can vary without the implied predictive output changing. The details of the myth are unconnected to the details of the phenomena 
- it is easy to update the specifics of the myth to account for conflicting observations
