- the doctrine that science always explains and predicts things reductively i.e. by analysing them into components 
- [[instrumentalism]] is rather like reductionism, but instead of rejecting only higher-level explanation it tries to evade all explanations 
- The [[principle of mediocrity]] is a milder form of reductionism, rejecting only high level explanations that involve people. 
- The opposite of reduction is [[holism]]
- in sum, those that believe "*Wholes are nothing but their parts*"
