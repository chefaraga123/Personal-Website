- the doctrine that science always explains and predicts things reductively i.e. by analysing them into components 
- **[instrumentalism](../notes/instrumentalism)** is rather like reductionism, but instead of rejecting only higher-level explanation it tries to evade all explanations 
- The **[principle of mediocrity](../notes/principle_of_mediocrity)** is a milder form of reductionism, rejecting only high level explanations that involve people. 
- The opposite of reduction is **[holism](../notes/holism)**
- in sum, those that believe "*Wholes are nothing but their parts*"
