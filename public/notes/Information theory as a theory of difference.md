- Information theory is often conceived of in terms of a theory of difference. This tendency can be traced back to the formulation that information *is a difference that makes a difference*
- Information is information only if its not just an existing different; it is information only if it instigates a change of state in the [[System]]
- Information processing in its entirety takes place between an initial difference and a difference that emerges during and in consequence of the process. 

- A system is not a unity, a system is a difference - with the consequence that we have the difficulty of conceiving of a unity of a difference
