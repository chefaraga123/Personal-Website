- The concept of the multiplicity exists to replace the concept of the essence 
- The term multiplicity is closely related to the idea of the ***[[manifold]]***, 
	- related to the ideas of [[Topological Equivalence]]?

- Takes a key idea from a manifold, namely the existence of a variable number off dimensions, and the absence of a higher-dimension imposing extrinsic coordinatization 

- There are a large number of different physical structures which form spontaneously as their components move towards energetic requirements. These components may be constrained e.g. 
	- **A Soap Bubble:** acquires its spherical form by minimising surface tensions
	- **A Salt Crystal**: takes the form of a cube by minimising bonding energy 
- The [[topological space]] of this process can be thought of as a single point attractor, *representing the minimum point of energy*
