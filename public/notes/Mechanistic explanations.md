- The [[Compositional Explanation]] of a higher process works by illuminating how it is composed by the qualitatively different productive processes posited in intra-level explanations at lower levels. 
- **For example**
	- [[a mechanistic explanation using Diamonds and Carbon Atoms]]
	- [[a mechanistic explanation of Ion Channels and their protein sub-units]]
- **productive closure** across the distinct levels of individuals within a compositional hierarchy 
	- **productive relations within a compositional hierarchy are exclusively intra-level relations.**
