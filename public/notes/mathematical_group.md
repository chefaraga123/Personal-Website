- In mathematics, a group is a fundamental algebraic structure that consists of a set equipped with a binary operation that satisfies certain properties. While a group is related to a set, they are not the same thing.

### Here are the key components of a group:

1. **Set**: A set is a collection of distinct objects, called elements. In the context of a group, this set forms the underlying structure on which the group operates.
    
2. **Binary Operation**: This is a mathematical operation that takes two elements from the set and produces another element in the set. Common examples of binary operations include addition, multiplication, and composition.
    
3. **Closure**: For any two elements $a$ and $b$ in the group, the result of the binary operation $a \cdot b$ is also an element of the group. In other words, the operation is closed under the group's set.
    
4. **Identity Element**: There exists an element, usually denoted as $e$, called the identity element, such that for any element $a$ in the group, $a ⋅e$$=$$e⋅a$$=$$a$.
