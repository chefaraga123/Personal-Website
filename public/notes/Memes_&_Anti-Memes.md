- The extent to which something is an anti-meme is proportional to the difference between the impact of a phenomena and the extent to which its discussed. 

**Memes as replicators**
- Thinking of memes like genes, as replicators occupying a fitness landscape. 

**Conditions that inhibit replication**
- Taboo 
- When there is a personal cost incurred in the discussion of a particular topic, 
- The topic is boring, 
- The topic is too abstract, confusing, illegible. 
- **self-defeating propagation** 
	- e.g. viruses that kill their hosts 
	- Fashion trends that die out 
	- Network effect pollution , loss of novelty 
	- adaptve response on the part of the host 

**Examples of anti-memes**
- Rape gangs: I think those two things work in concert, social taboo around a topic suppresses discourse.Rape gang sounds too bad to be real? Metamorphoses into fantasy... many people can't comprehend the existence of that kind of abuse at scale i.e. the reciprocal anti-white discourse 
- How is a **taboo** created? I.e. the transformation of meme into anti-meme. 
- In a prudish society sex is an anti-meme as people find it uncomfortable to discuss. 
- Demographics is an anti-meme, extremely large impact much smaller surface area of discussion

**Key Mechanisms for Meme Success & Anti-Meme Resistance:**
- What makes a meme, adheres to one of the 7 deadly sins
- **Triggers Emotion**
	- How does ASMR work?
- **Production Quality** plays an important role. Two sides: hook & UI/UX. 
- **Mirror Effect**: the meme reflects the audience's own desires, perceptions etc.. 
- **Disposability towards sharing:**
	- Visual appeal 
	- Easily Legible 
	- Call to Action 
- **Short-Form Videos & a High-Velocity Ecology**: are a great mimetic vehicle, one can consume a large volume of unique pieces of short-form content  - intensely selective ecology. 
- **Financial Incentives**, memecoins already existed, but PumpFun took it to the next level by obviating the cost of creating the direct cost of producing a memecoin.  

**Meme Dynamics**
- Memes work via positive-feedback loops, k > 1
	- Feedback loops are partially enforced through platforms 
- Anti-Memes via negative-feedback loops, k << 1

**Hyperstition and Retrocausality**
- Hyperstition: the future retrocausally affects the present. Stories are anchors in the future that reach back in time to dictate current behaviour.
