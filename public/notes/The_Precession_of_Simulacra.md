Today abstraction is no longer that of the map, the double or the concept. Simulation is no longer that of a territory or a referential being. 

*The sovereign difference between the one and the other has disappeared.*

*The era of simulation is inaugurated by the liquidation of all referentials.* 

*It is no longer a question of substituting the signs of the real for the real*

*It is a question of substituting the signs of the real for the real*

What becomes of divinity when it is multiplied in simulacra?

*God never existed, only the simulacra ever existed, even if God was never anything but his own simulacrum*

The objective of destroying simulacra was from the concern that these images obfuscated the platonic ideal of God.

All Western faith, and good faith, become engaged in this wager on representation: that a sign could refer to the depth of meaning, that a sign could be exchanged for meaning and that something could guarantee this exchange - God. 

What if God can be simulated - that is to say, reduced to the signs that constitute faith. 

Representation stems from the principle of equivalence of the sign and the real.

When the real is no longer what it was, nostalgia assumes its full meaning. 

The duplication suffices to render both artificial. 


### Disneyland
Disneyland as the perfect model of all the entangled orders of simulacra 
*Disneyland exists in order to hide that it is the real country, all of real America that is Disneyland.*
Disneyland is presented as imaginary in order to convince us that the rest is real, whereas all of America that surrounds it is no longer real

#### Watergate
The denunciation of scandal is always a homage to the law. 
A simulation of scandal for regenerative ends.

From a political pov that a head of state remains the same or is someone else doesn't strictly change anything, so long as they resemble each other. For a long time now a head of state - no matter which one - is nothing but the simulacrum of himself.
