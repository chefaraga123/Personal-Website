# Proteins  

Protein molecules, of which there are thought to be 80,000 - 400,000 varieties in human cells, are the second key functional component of life alongside the nucleic acids DNA & RNA.  

Even after genes were acknowledged as being made of DNA, it was long believed that the gene’s main role was to encode a protein. Along the current of this view, proteins are more or less synonymous with enzymes.  

Proteins belong to a class of molecules called polypeptides, in which amino acids are strung together in a chain via chemical linkages called peptide bonds. In enzymes, these chains fold up into compact forms with specific shapes that allow each protein enzyme to do its job.  

The sequence of amino acids in proteins is determined from information encoded in the corresponding messenger RNA (mRNA) according to the genetic code that links triplets of RNA bases to specific amino acids.  

This information in mRNA is read out by the **Ribosome**, the molecular assembly that makes proteins.

## Protein Folding  

The Ribosome generates the bare polypeptide chain, which contains approximately 300 amino acids.  
The chain then acquires its folded form due to several types of chemical interaction.  

- The polypeptide chain, once folded, constitutes the functional protein.  
- Each protein folds in a different way; however, most of them contain recurring folded structures, known as **motifs**.  
- The protein aims to achieve the **lowest energy possible**, corresponding to the native fold.  
- The number of possible folding configurations is practically infinite. Despite this, proteins do fold correctly.  
- When proteins are unfolded (**denatured**), they often return to their original states.  

In 2021, **DeepMind** announced a protein folding algorithm called **AlphaFold2**, which could predict known structures.  

- **AlphaFold** has made predictions for nearly all the proteins currently known to biological science (~200 million).  
- DeepMind’s approach doesn’t assert anything about the protein folding process itself but instead predicts the end state based on the underlying amino acid sequence.  

For **drug design**, this is interesting because many drugs work by binding to and disabling or modifying the activity of an enzyme thought to be involved in a disease.  

- To design a molecule that will bind to & block the action of an enzyme, knowledge of the **protein structure** is a useful basis.  
- However, a good drug also needs a **strong binding affinity** for the protein—a propensity to stick to it firmly—which can’t currently be deduced from structure alone.  
- A good drug also needs **good pharmacological properties**: the body has to be able to absorb and then clear it from its system.  
- These considerations highlight the problems with relying on the properties of single genes or biomolecules for curing diseases.

## Structure & Foundation  

The structure of biomolecules was studied mostly using **crystallography**.  

- Crystallography involves bouncing **X-rays** off crystals and analyzing the patterns formed by the reflected rays.  
- These diffraction patterns are created by interference between the X-ray beams as they bounce off different layers of regularly spaced atoms in the crystal.  
- Given these patterns, it is possible to work out the positions of all the atoms.  

Another technique is **Cryo-Electron Microscopy (Cryo-EM)**, which helps determine the structures of complex molecules.  

- This technique uses **beams of electrons** to produce extremely detailed images of molecules.  
- **Electron microscopy** has existed since the 1960s and can resolve finer details than a light microscope because the wavelength of an electron is shorter than that of visible light.  
- The size of objects a microscope can resolve is roughly the same size as the wavelength of the illumination it shines on the sample.  

In **Cryo-EM**, the sample is cooled to a very low temperature:  

- This freezes molecular motion.  
- It reduces damage caused by high-energy electrons on delicate materials such as biomolecules.

The prevailing view has been that a protein’s **structure dictates its function**.  
Typically, an enzyme only has **one job**—and is **extremely effective** at it.
