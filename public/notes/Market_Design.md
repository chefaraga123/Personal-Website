- as a practical matter, market design justified the piecemeal marketisation of government functions and ultimately full privatisation; as a theoretical matter, this served to degrade the cognitive capacities of the agent. 
- Market design constitutes the precepts of [[Neoliberalism]] taken to their logical conclusion 

- Market design consolidates [[The Socialist Calculation Controversy]], [[mechanism design]], [[Information Economics]]

- In 2014, the Journal of Economic Literature (JEL) designated market design an official field of study. 
- The subject guide has the following description 
		*Covers studies concerning the deign and evolution of economic institutions, the designs of mechanisms for economic transactions (such as price determination and dispute resolution) and the interplay between a market's size and the information available to agents in such an environment*

[[The epistemology of economic agents]] is very important for market design 

***Changes in how economists conceptualised information lead to changes in how economists conceptualised markets***

Thinking of economists' take on markets as being split into three phases:

**Phase 1**: Economists conceived of markets generically, undifferentiated, left devoid of any institutional specificity 

**Phase 2**: Economists viewed markets as taking one of a handful of highly stylised formats (English auctions, Dutch auctions)

**Phase 3**: Individual markets viewed as algorithms, and like algorithms, serving a variety of purposes 


During the 1990s market designers sought to demonstrate they could skew markets in favour of certain participants. 
A tension emerged 
*markets would be preferred to bureaucracies on the grounds of transparency and efficiency; yet, only market designers could truly understand their setup and operation*

Auctions introduced into: *electricity generation capacity (with disastrous results!), greenhouse gas emissions, railroads*, and notably TARP (Toxic Assets Relief Plan) which was devised in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.
