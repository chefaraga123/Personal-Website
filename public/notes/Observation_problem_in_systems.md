- Does one have to assume, in general, or in the case of certain systems that systems have operations at their disposal that are capable of observing (in the sense of making distinctions)
- Does one have to impute observational capacities to a system? And if so, which kind of operations within the system are able to perform these observations?
- Are there larger systems that are able to internally differentiate their observational performance in order to increase their capacity in relation to their environment?
-
- Who would be the observer of a social system, if one merely did not mean to say that every individual operation, every action, every communication must know what it is doing -
- But if in addition, one tried to imagine that there are reflecting entities & reflecting units that although they constitute part of a system, have a higher capacity for reflection than the entire system?
	- Is this some type of **[Emergence](../notes/Emergence)**?

- Is there a difference between object & subject, between the object of observation and the observer, that is not already predetermined due to the operational basis that is common to both sides?
	- Is it not the observer who introduces the difference between the observer and the observed object 
	
- How can one conceive of an observation, if the observer themselves is not considered to be a system?

- One must face the question of why the subject is not said to be a system, or how should one conceive of a subject if one does not consider the systematic nature of its operations 
- The classical **[Transcendental Theoretical Epistemology](../notes/Transcendental_Theoretical_Epistemology)** perspective is that one must distinguish between **[a priori](../notes/a_priori)** conditions of experience which are identical for all subjects and the empirical enactment of these conditions which is idiosyncratic to the subject.
