De Landa: *a philosopher's ontology is the set of entities they assume to exist in reality*

Ontology relates to a philosophers about what can be held to be true, or to exist, within reality 

#### The three main types of ontology 

##### Ontology a:
Reality has no existence independent from the human mind that perceives it - so their ontology mainly consists of mental entities. 


##### **Ontology b:** 
Objects of everyday experience experience a mind-independent existence. However they may be unconvinced as to the existence of theoretical entities, whether *unobservable relations such as physical causes* or *unobservable entities such as electrons*

##### **Ontology C:** [[Realist Ontology]] 
Rejection of the difference between the observed and the unobserved

| Relative Ontology | Realist Ontology |  |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Reality is contingent on human perception | Objects and worldly phenomena exist independently of human observation  |  |
