The growth in industry **pre-WW1** was primarily achieved through horizontal combination or vertical integration. 
**Post-WW1** the expansion resulted broadly from moves into new geographical markets either domestically or internationally. 

### The history of oil 
The [[Standard Oil Company]] was one of the first in the world to exploit the economies of scale by making the three interrelated investments in:
- Production
- Marketing 
- Management 

The oil industry differs from other American industries insofar it very rapidly saw its major market as Europe, not America. 

In oil, as many other industries, it was the processors, not the producers of raw materials that created the modern industrial enterprise. 

The potential for exploiting [[economies of scale]] was much greater in refining oil than extracting crude oil out of the ground. 

The resulting volume of output gave the partners a powerful weapoin with which to reduce transportation. 

The standard oil works in Cleveland were the largest in the world, halving the unit costs. 
The resulting volume of output gave the partners a powerful weapon with which to reduce transportation costs. In oil, as in nearly every other American industry, competition between railroads increased the power oof the large shippers. 
The intense pressure exerted upon the railroads by their very high fixed costs led their operators to grant reduced rates, usually in the form of rebates for higher-volume shipments.

It was the throughout that lead to the low rates, not the other way round. 

Standard oil exchanged its stock with stock in 30 other companies, providing a discipline mechanism that served to compete the competition in line. 

The members of the alliance were legally and administratively independent. 

It was the technological innovation in distribution, not refining, that federation into the Standard Oil Trust.

The pipeline also served as a storage area and thus assured a steadier flow of crude oil into the refineries.
