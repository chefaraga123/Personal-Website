Set of problems tied to the emergence of population 

Transition from "advice to the prince", to the "art of government"

The problem of government seems to explode in the 16th century 

Several questions 
- How to govern oneself
	- Connected to morality
- How to be governed 
	- Connected to economy
- How to govern others 
	- Connected to politics
- By whom the people will accept being governed 
- How to become the best governor 

The 16th century lies at two crossroad: shattering the structures of feudalism and the establishment of great territorial, administrative, colonial states and a totally different movement that, with [[the reformation]] and [[the counter-reformation]], raising the question of how one must be spiritually ruled on Earth to achieve eternal salvation. 

There is the double movement of state centralisation on one hand and dispersion & religious dissidence on the other. 

With Clausewitz - the problem of the relationship between politics and strategy - and lies in connection with the problem of Italian and German territorial unity. 

the art of government is defined in a way that differentiates it from a certain capacity of the prince. 

The relation between the prince and his principality is purely synthetic, the external nature of this link means that it will be fragile and continually under threat - from outside by enemies that wish to conquer the principality, or internally, from subjects with no *[[a priori]]* reason to accept his rule. 

***The Prince*** is essentially a treatise about the prince's ability to keep his principality. Having the art of retaining one's principality is not at all the same as possessing the art of governing.

The word economy can only be properly used to signify the wide government of the family for the common welfare of all. The word economy signified a form of government. 

for Machiavelli the object and the target of power are two things - on the one hand the territory and the other it's inhabitants. In this respect, Machiavelli simply adapted to his particular aims a juridicial principle that from the Middle Ages to the 16th century defined sovereignty in public law: sovereignty is excersised not on things but above all on a territory and consequently on the subjects who inhabit it. 

Government is in by no means understood with respect to territory: one governs *things*

The art of government find its first form, organised around the theme of reason of state, understood not in a negative or pejorative sense but in a full & positive sense: the state is governed by rational principles intrinsic to it & cannot be derived solely from natural or divine laws or the principles of wisdom & prudence. 

Contract theory enables the founding contract, the mutual pledge of ruler & subjects, to function as a sort of theoretical matrix for deriving the general principles of an art of government 

Framework of sovereignty was too abstract
Theory of government suffered from its reliance on a model that was too thin - the family. 

the domain of population involves a range of intrinsic aggregate effects, phenomena that are irreducible to those of the family, such as epidemics, endemic levels of morality, ascending spirals of labour & wealth  - aggregate statistics are irreducible to the level of the family. 

The family transmutes from a model to an instrument.

In contrast to sovereignty population appears above all else as the ultimate end of government l
