- **Prime Fields**: These fields have $p$ elements, where $p$ is a prime number. The elements can be represented by integers from $0$ to $p-1$. Arithmetic operations in a prime field are performed modulo $p$

- **Binary Fields**: these fields have $2^n$ elements where the arithmetic is based on binary polynomials rather than integers
