- This is not titled **[Information Economics](../notes/Information_Economics)**, as this is not about the subfield within **[Economics](../notes/Economics)**, it is about how the concept of *information* found its way into the economics discipline 

As explored by ****[Jacob Marshack](../notes/Jacob_Marshack)****, **[modalities of information in neoclassical theory](../notes/modalities_of_information_in_neoclassical_theory)**:
- **Shannon Information** 
- **Blackwell Formalism** - suggested an instrument reading was more informative if it could distinguish observations over a finer partition of the state space of possibilities.
	- **[Information theory as a theory of difference](../notes/Information_theory_as_a_theory_of_difference)**?
- Transaction costs as information 

**[Leonard Hurwicz](../notes/Leonard_Hurwicz)** was another early contributor at the intersection of information theory and economics, and one of the early progenitors of **[mechanism design](../notes/mechanism_design)**
