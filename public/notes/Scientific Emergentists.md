- [[Emergence]]
- The ontological position that "*Wholes are more than the sum of their parts*"
- endorse a "strong emergence" in composed properties of higher-level individuals that are nonetheless determinative
- Strong emergence is the only viable response to the arguments of [[Scientific reductionism]]
- Given the [[conditioned view of aggregation]] scientific emergentists endorse a novel kind of [[downward determination (machresis)]] from wholes to their parts

- **Embrace discontinuities** in the powers of the components we find across simpler collectives where components are claimed to be downwardly determined by emergent composed entities
