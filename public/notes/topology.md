- Topology concerns the properties of a space which are left unchanged by the kind of transformation that we have called a [[Topological Equivalence]] or [[Homeomorphic]]. 

- What sorts of spaces are interesting? What  is meant by a space?



- Poincare classified certain special topological features of two-dimensional [[manifold]]s, called **singularities** 
- These singularities can influence the behaviour of dynamical systems by acting as attractors for trajectories *to define and understand better*
- Divergent initial conditions in a system may tend towards the same final state, the attractor, as long as all of them started within what is known as the *basin of attraction*
- These singularities can be construed as representing the long-term tendencies of the system 
- These singularities are recurrent topological features - meaning that different sets of equations, representing different physical system may possess a similar distribution of attractors.
