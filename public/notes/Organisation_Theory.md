- [[Information Economics]]

#### Introduction 
- Organisation theorists began to consider designing new institutions, ranging from novel legal regimes, to "solutions" for public goods provision, to the reorganisation of entire economies 
- The pretensions to evaluate organisation transmuted into what is now known as [[market design]]. 
- Whilst [[Neoclassical Economics]] stresses the existence of a generic and omnipresent market, market design was centred on the repudiation of this imperative. 

#### Central questions of organisation theorists included:
- What constraints or laws govern the (design of) internal processes of organisations including markets?
- What constraints or laws govern the endogenous adaptation of organisations to changing environments?
