- The **[Compositional Explanation](../notes/Compositional_Explanation)** of a higher process works by illuminating how it is composed by the qualitatively different productive processes posited in intra-level explanations at lower levels. 
- **For example**
	- **[a mechanistic explanation using Diamonds and Carbon Atoms](../notes/a_mechanistic_explanation_using_Diamonds_and_Carbon_Atoms)**
	- **[a mechanistic explanation of Ion Channels and their protein sub-units](../notes/a_mechanistic_explanation_of_Ion_Channels_and_their_protein_sub-units)**
- **productive closure** across the distinct levels of individuals within a compositional hierarchy 
	- **productive relations within a compositional hierarchy are exclusively intra-level relations.**
