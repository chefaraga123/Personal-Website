Issue during the 1950s was the political status of science and ideological functions it could serve. 

If concerning a science, one poses the problem of its relations with the political and economic structures of society, isn't one posing an excessively complicated question

In the case of physics, with its correspondent epistemological profile it is very hard to resolve, whereas a a field with a low-epistemic profile such as psychiatry the interweaving effects of power & knowledge can be grasped with some clarity. 

Marxism sought to win acceptance as a solution to renew the liberal university tradition. 

Marxists were positivists

***in certain empiricial forms of knowledge like biology, political economy, psychiatry, medicine, and son on the rhythm of transformation doesn't follow smooth continuist schemas of development***

What leads to a global modification of the internal regime of power within science 

dichotomy between *structures* (the thinkable) and the event considered as the site of the irrational, the unthinkable. The event is the domain of *absolute contingency*

History has no *meaning*, not to say that it is absurd or incoherent. 

Posing for discourse the question of power means basically asking to whom discourse serves 

geneaology = a form of history that can account for the constitution of knowledge, discourses, domains of objects and so on without having to make reference to a subject that is either transcendental in relation to the field of events or runs in empty sameness throughout the course of histroy. 

ideology always stands in virtual opportunity to something else that is supposed to count as truth 

"scientificity" as opposed to truth. 

What makes power hold good, what makes it accepted, is simply the fact that it doesn't only weigh on us as a force that says no; it also traverse and produces things, it induces pleasure, forms knowledge, produces discourse. 

Wanted to show in **Discpline and Punish** there was a veritable technological take-off in the productivity of power. 

Need a political philosophy that isn't constructed around the problem of sovereignty or therefor around the problems of law and prohibition 

To pose the problem of power in terms of the state is to pose it in terms of sovereign or sovereignty i.e. in terms of  law. 
Relations of power necessarily extend beyond the limits of the state, in two senses:
- Far from being able to occupy the whole field of actual power relations 
- the state operates on the basis of other, already existing, power relations

Power as an objectve of research - invert Clausewitz's formula so as to arrive at the idea that politics is the continuation of war by other means. 

People talk about warlike relations of power/class strugle without ever making it clear whether some form of war is meant and if so what form. 

What Foucault found interesting about the technologies of power introduced in the 17/18th centuries is their concrete and precise character - the significance of methods such as school discipline, here the problem emerges of demography, public health, hygiene, etc... The political significance of sex is due to its location at the intersection of the discipline of the body & control of the population.
