- **Cyclic Groups**: 
	- A [[mathematical group]] in which each element can be expressed as a power of a particular element (called the generator) 
	- ELI5: each element can be got by repeatedly multiply a special number (the generator()


- **Generator**: In a cyclic group, there exists a special element, called a ***generator***, that can be combined with itself multiple times to generate all other elements within the group. This process is often referred to as "cycling through" the elements of the group.
    
- **Closure**: When you repeatedly combine the generator with itself, you eventually cycle back to the original generator. This property is known as closure, meaning that the result of combining any two elements within the group is also an element of the group.
    
- **Order**: The order of a cyclic group refers to the number of elements it contains. For example, if the generator is combined with itself a certain number of times before cycling back to the original generator, that number represents the order of the group.
