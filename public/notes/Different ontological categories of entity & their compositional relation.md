- **types of entity | compositional relation **
	- properties | lower level properties **realise** higher-level properties
	- individuals | lower level individuals **constitute** higher-level individuals 
	- processes | lower level individuals **implement** higher-level processes
- sciences are ontological in character because they concern relations between entities in the world. 
- To articulate such entity types we need a minimum ontological framework 
	- **individuals** are located in space-time, and to instantiate properties and relations that contribute powers to them. Individuals are individuated by their properties (**& tendencies/capacities?**)
