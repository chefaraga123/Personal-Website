### Marketing & Vision 
- Need to capitalise on the grooming gangs - provide media trainings to victims - cut up in high-quality short-form content edits 
	- We need to make a Mr Beast 
- Forward looking, **England doesn't exist. Britain doesn't exist.**, we are necessarily forging something new - we are clarifying the social contract so that what is birthed can exist into the future. the social revolution of the 1990s thrust forward its own world view - this has demonstrably failed. 
- The future is made of the past. The past is a future country. 
### Pipeline 
- There is a lack of talent in all political parties, including Reform, this is a tough problem for every party as historically parties would have their own training colleges e.g. Conservative party did. Beyond party politics there is a lack of talent in the domain of politics as a whole. 
- In America Think Tanks and NGO serves as a hedging apparatus - how can political allies who aren't currently in office stay up-to-date in politics - people can rotate in and out of Think Tank / NGO.
- Think Tanks in the UK have no money e.g. **Market Map of UK Think Tanks**
- An army of constitutional lawyers and right wing thinkers who are able to prepare implementable policy 
- What is the idea-gen -> implementable policy pipeline?
### Demographics 
- Which media platform for each demographic 
	- TikTok
	- Twitter
	- IG
	- Facebook
	- TV
	- Newspapers
- what is the demographic breakdown of voters 
- Can you do hyperlocalised campaigns? What type of grassroots infrastructure is needed 
- How many years before South Africa? Yugoslavia?

- Boomers want in because they are bag holders via the housing market which has been pumping as a function by "human quantitative easing"
- **Pension Reform: breaking the triple lock, JUST DO IT** 

### Pillars 
- **Legal support for political allies** 
- **Media training for sympathetic victims** 
- **Policy Pipeline for success**
### Legal-Practical
- Where does spending occur in the UK? Social care costs etc... 
- What does it mean to opt out of basically ALL international law? ECHR etc... 

Top of funnel produce high quality digestible research with clear provocative conclusions which generates mindshare which is how you then get MPs to read it. which bootstraps the legitimacy for the former point 
Very few people are actually working on high quality stuff because there are almost no well financed entities paying people to do it. The demand side is a massive constraint. The base pay is like £30k - £40k a year!
So either generate implementable policy which can practically be put in place when the government comes to power. Essentially the people in government do not have their shit together and the first mover advantage of having some workable is massive.  

Generating thought pieces and research as most do is bad tactics as MPs simply don't read.
In the UK, if you're not in power you have to do something else, you have to be an advisor to random companies, do random speaking tickets - you essentially exit the arena and your capacities atrophy. Having a think tank can keep allies focused and bought in
it is what happens in America, you have legitimately well funded think tanks on the neoliberal right which are actually an active part of the political superstructure
think tank is so interesting because it can serve as a hedging mechanism for potential allies

Example: Civic Future

They essentially extended Christian morality of people being equal before God to mean that this is LITERALLY true, and hence all difference in outcomes owes only to evil
yes it MUST be done for the political movement to be successful
for any political movement to have any enduring success
Christian Nationalism consistently fails

Reform doesn't know how to save money or do anything real beyond the headlines: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cly9m75101lo

so for instance, basically everyone in the UK elite circles read this essay: https://ukfoundations.co/

Its a pipeline of:

Memes -—> short-form articles —> long-form articles —> research grade work —> implementable policy

We need to capture the whole pipeline and as a product we're ultimately shipping a novel world vision of which the different elements of the pipeline represent different levels of abstractions. I think it is right to start at the top of the pipeline
the warhead is the memes
He said it was previously just a matter of signing up a regional coordinator but now they have this Oxbridge academic called James Orr to oversee part of the process
Assuming one strategy is to construct a Rupert Lowe type Zoomer
As a wedge into the party

The shpiel and the writing is secondary to viral marketing - bluntly speaking - can't think that Beglan's take would be particularly incisive at the end of the day. 

Where is the deficiency - why do we need a new thing - where do we see the deficiency in what's already provided 
- Not going to commit to massive remigration 
- Not prepared to kill pensions 
Very different issues of what want to do, some are 
Convincing the UK public to not get pensions is politically impossible
