- Not trivial to define "system" precisely, a system may be an object of study, but there is also the question of the the difference between the system and its environment comes about - assuming we locate a system and its environment on sides of some difference 
- How is it possible to reproduce a difference of this kind and maintain it? And perhaps develop it in an evolutionary fashion by making it possible for its own ever increasing complexity to be available within the system on just one side of the difference 
- On the basis of what kind of operations do systems reproduce differences?
- **The deciding factor is closure, that is, operational recursiveness, self-reference and circularity**


- Thus, how does a system refer to itself, more precisely, how it can distinguish itself and its environment in such a manner that its own operations can be connected with the help of this distinction to an  increasing number of its own operations 
`This I found very confusing, I don't think Luhmann did a great job of setting up the idea that a system is composed of a number of discrete operators which themselves have to distinguish amongst themselves their difference from the environment  `

- How can an operation recognise internally that certain operations belong to the system and that others don't 
- This problem has become important for say **[immunology](../notes/immunology)** 

`Should make a seperate doc on the role of the observer?`
- There is an **[observation problem in systems](../notes/observation_problem_in_systems)**
-
- Historically the scientist was tacitly assumed to play the role of observer 
- Types of systems theories are: **[analytic systems theory](../notes/analytic_systems_theory)** and **[concrete systems theory](../notes/concrete_systems_theory)**
