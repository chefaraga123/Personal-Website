- The motivation for **[MUD the fully-chain game engine](../notes/MUD_the_fully-chain_game_engine)**
- There were many difficulties associated with building FOCGs, including:
	- The coupling of state and logic in **[Smart Contract](../notes/Smart_Contract)**s making upgrading logic difficult
	- the lack of scynchrony between the chain and the **[client](../notes/client)** leading to inconsistencies in game state
	- Irregularities with access controls pose problems for would-be third-party developers attempting to create their own plugins and **[client](../notes/client)**s
- MUD is maximally on-chain, the entire application state lives in the EVM, and the only requirement for clients and front-ends is an **[Ethereum Node](../notes/Ethereum_Node)**
