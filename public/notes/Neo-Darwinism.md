- The central idea of neo-Darwinism is that evolution favours the genes that spread best through the population
- A common misconception of Darwinism is that it maximises the "good of the species"
- Whilst genes may at some point be optimally adapted for maximising the population, it is not a stable situation. There will be evolutionary pressure that may make those genes become less well adapted to that function 
- Neo-Darwinism doesn't refer necessarily to anything biological. It is based on the idea of a **[replicator](../notes/replicator)**.
