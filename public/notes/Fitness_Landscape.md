- A possibility space of self-replicating entities to which **[fitness](../notes/fitness)** values have been assigned. 
- The structure of the space depends upon the distribution of **[singularities](../notes/singularities)**, sequences of nucleotides with optimum fitness, and how fitness varies in the neighbourhood of singularities
