### Annulus Definition 
- An annulus is a geometric shape that resembles a ring or a doughnut. It is formed by taking a disk (a two-dimensional circle) and removing another smaller disk from its center. 

- **Mathematically, an annulus can be described as the region between two concentric circles**. The distance between the centers of the two circles is the width of the annulus, and the radius of each circle determines the size of the hole in the center and the outer boundary of the annulus.

#### An Open Annulus 
- Refers to a specific type of annulus, where the the the boundary of the annulus is excluded from the set. 
- Ah open annulus consists of all the points that lie between two concentric circles without including the points on the circles themselves 
- Mathematically, can be described as the set of points in the plane that satisfy the condition $r_1 <\sqrt{x^2+y^2} <r_2$
