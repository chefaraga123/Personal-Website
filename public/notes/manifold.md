- a term which designates a geometrical space with certain characteristic properties.
- It refers specifically, to an N-dimensions curved structure defined exclusively by its own intrinsic (*local?*) features. 


- Belonging to the [[differential geometry]] of Gauss and Riemann 

##### For historical context
- Descartes & Fermat invented the familiar method of embedding curves into a 2-D space onto which arbitrary axis could be fixed 
- Once embedded, the fixed axes allowed for the assignment of a pair of numbers, or coordinates, to every point on the curve, so that the geometric relations between points could be expressed as relations between numbers - a task for which algebra was suited. 

- The manifold emerged given the problem-solving toolkit of calculus, *calculus in its original formulation was used to solve problems involving relations between the changes of 2, or more, quantities. In particular if these problems were expressed as the rate of change of one quantity relative to another *
- Calculus allowed us to find the instantaneous value for that rate.

- A geometrical object, a curved line or surface for instance, could be characterised by the rate at which some of its properties changed - *for example, the rate at which its curvature changed between different points*

- Gauss realised that calculus allowed for the study of a surface without any reference being made to a global embedding space - hence the surface was dealt with in terms of only its own local properties.
