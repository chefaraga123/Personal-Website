*The strong stress on [[Operational Closure]] in the discussion of [[Autopoiesis]] left open the question of how the relations with the environment are regulated, i.e. which forms and conceptual resources are at our disposal to describe the relationship between system and environment*

- The system concept is a difference concept, this form has two sides, on one side is the system the other the environment 

Systems are dual entities defined in reference to their environment  

In the [[Theory of Evolution]] there are two apparent tendencies towards explaining the relation between a system and its environment 
- the possibility of declaring that this relation is contingent in the domain of *variation impulses*. i.e. that the concept of contingency is deployed in such a way that it could be proposed that systems are able to develop in an environment that contingently acts as the impetus for system changes 
- The other works with the idea of natural selection of forms that survive 

An essential property of a system is to be able to transform noise from its environment into order inside the system. 
*information is the system's own product*

the concept of structural coupling is intended to fill the gap with regard to causal relations between system and its environment. 

Structural coupling doesn't refer to the entire environment, not everything that exists is structurally coupled with the system. Couplings are highly selective, the environment is divided into what is included and what is excluded. 

The brain is structurally coupled with the external environment by eye and ear. 
The system doesn't have direct contact with its environment and is instead stimulated photo-mechanically or acoustically. 

Reduction is the condition of building complexity 

A disturbance leads to the reconstitution of equilibrium 
It is not necessary to maintain balance by returning to the prior state. 
Stability can be maintained in the presence of imbalance 

Disturbance means the intitiation of information processing that can be handled operationally in the system. 

Ever since the 50s the concept of information has lost clarity, 
- there was a way of talking about biological information that spoke of genetic codes as information - although as a matter of fact they contain structures and not events. 
- The semantic side of the concept & thus the question from what resource information can actually be selected remained unclear. 
One must distinguish between meaning, or even relative structural invariants, and the surprise effect of a piece of information. 
Information is a 2 sided concept 

Information always presupposes that one delimits one possibility as opposed to other possibilities & that within a range of possibilities one or the other is presented as information. 
Information is a selection from a range of possibilities. 
A repeated selection contains no information.
