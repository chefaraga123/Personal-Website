# Emergent Phenomena
- Whenever a high-level explanation does follow logically from low-level ones that also means that the high-level one implies something about the low-level ones 
- Additional high-level theories, provided they were consistent, would place more constraints on what the low-level theories could be. 
- Emergent phenomena are essential to the explicability of the world. Long before humans had explanatory knowledge they were able to control nature using **[Heuristics](../notes/Heuristics)** . **[Heuristics](../notes/Heuristics)**  have explanations and those explanations were about high-level regularities among emergent phenomena such as fire & rocks. 
- **[Emergence](../notes/Emergence)**  is responsible for the fact that discoveries can be made in successive  partial success of each theory on.
