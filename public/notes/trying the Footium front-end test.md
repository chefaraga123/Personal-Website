- given a bootstrapped project w/ create-react-app, implement some functionality  
- Given
	- The pitch
	- all the players and their stats are stored in the background 
- **Desired functionality** 
	- Create drag & drop of player cards onto a football pitch background (provided)
	- [[Creating drag and drop functionality for Web]]
- Steps
	- To each player element add the `draggable` attribute 
	- Define an `onDragStart` event handle that sets the data to be transferred 
- In Typescript
	- you need to add types to your props, state and event handlers for type safety 
- **There are various types already included**
	- `PlayerPositions
	- `PlayerPositionStat
	- `Player 
	- `Team


- **`=> {   }` vs `=> (    )`**
	- `=> { }`  is used when you want to execute multiple statements in the function body
	- `=> ( )` is used to return the expression inside the parentheses 
	
- Once the players have drag and drop functionality, drop zones need to be added into the pitch component. Each slot on the pitch represents a position where a player can be dropped 
- Create a new formation component

- I've got slots and draggability!
- my logic for setting the player to being clicked on is not working 
- State management for player positions
	- need to track where players are on the board - typically involves storing each player's position in the component's state 
	- Handling the drop event: when a player is dropped into a slot you update their position in the state
	- rendering players in their slots: you render positions based on their position state
- Logs from error
