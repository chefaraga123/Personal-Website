### Information as a thing
- Treating information as a fluid was ubiquitous in post-war **[Neoclassical Economics](../notes/Neoclassical_Economics)**. Information as a think-like object in nature meant that information could be treated as any other good in the commodity space - and hence entails no breaking changes to be made to the existing economic models 
- A problem arose in how to measure/quantify information, this is where **[Claude Shannon](../notes/Claude_Shannon)**'s **[information theory](../notes/information_theory)** was used: Shannon had developed an argument suggesting that information could be treated like entropy in physics. 
	- *comparing it to the way in which a stochastic micro-dynamics of symbols could make up a measurable macro-state of messages*
- ***It became quite common to conflate the embodiments and encapsulation of knowledge in obkects and artifacts as mere epiphenomenal manifestations of a generic thing called information***
- Once information was construed as a good then arguments could begin over what type of good it might be
- Starting with **[Paul Samuelson](../notes/Paul_Samuelson)** and **[Kenneth Arrow](../notes/Kenneth_Arrow)** knowledge was claimed to be a weird type of thing which was "non-rivalrous" and also "non-excludable" - endowing information with *think-like* qualities inspired Akerlof's Lemon's paper 
- The study of **[asymmetric information](../notes/asymmetric_information)** was the first step towards the development of **[behavioural macroeconomics](../notes/behavioural_macroeconomics)**

### Information as an Inductive Index and/or the Stochastic Object of an Epistemic Logic  
- In the post-war period statistical tools of inductive inference began to get conflated with models of mind 
- A practise took hold of equating "information" with measures defined over partitions imposed an exhaustive total enumeration of states of the world, both actual and virtual. How much a procedure "knew" about a world was a function of how finely or coarsely it could divide up the possibilities distinguish the class of outcome and thus assign probabilities to eventual outcomes. 
- **The associated formalism developed in two directions**

#### The model consists of four basic components
**Reality is a pre-existent state space of possible worlds** 
- Knowledge is said to exist of partitions over a totally exhaustive state space, which distinguishes possible worlds by the inclusion or exclusion of a preset menu of variables. 
- The **[Ontology](../notes/Ontology)**  of this world is given and fixed prior to the analysis and is not altered by the activities of the knower, this resembles the ***block universe of relativistic physics*** where past/present/future coexist simultaneously in the state space 

**All information is inductive**
- Blackwell proposed that *experiments consisted of information extracted from the state space by inductive inference of probabilities attached to partitions of the state space*
- *information consists of signals emitted from experimental interventions, which serve to alter epistemic probabilities* defined over the space 
- Under this model, **[Neoclassical Economics](../notes/Neoclassical_Economics)** started to conflate any problem with information with some version of generic choice under uncertainty 
- Any epistemic problem was reduced to a set of probabilities induced over utility payoffs 

**The Harsanyi Nash Program**
- Game theorists combined the standard formalism of von Neumann-Morgenstern expected utility with the Nash solution concept in game theory. 
- The way this is often put is that all imperfections of information about the world under the guise of uncertainty in games must be reduced to uncertainty over **[parametric payoff functions](../notes/parametric_payoff_functions)**. 
- John Harsanyi saw that the existence of **[incomplete information](../notes/incomplete_information)** meant that game theorists would have to incorporate an infinite hierarchy of beliefs into their models of agency. These models would consist of a pyramid of beliefs for player i over parameter vector X in the state space consisting of 
- ***First-order beliefs***: *Player i's probability distribution over vector X*
- ***Second-order beliefs***: *Player j's probability distribution over player i's first order beliefs*
- ***Third-order beliefs***: *Player i's probability distribution over player j's second order beliefs*
- ***..... And so on***:
- Harsanyi reduced all problems in epistemology to problems in the definition of the agent.
- Harsanyi assert that a player's beliefs could be summarised within a single vector, known as the information vector. Plus the types of all his opponents into a single roster of typology of players. 
 
 **Common Knowledge**
 - The involution began with knowledge of the block universe, presumed recognised as true by all participants, incapable of expressing falsehood. 
 - All player types are equipped with identical bayesian priors
