Reality is a relation 

if the difference between two things is real - they both reduce to a common reality & are to that extent similar.

The concept of **syndiffeonesis** can be captured by asserting that the expression and/or existence of any difference relation entails a ***common medium & syntax i.e. the rules of state and transformation characterising the medium***.

It is from these rules that the relation derives its spatial-temporal characteristics as expressed within the medium. 

- How does this relate to the implied conceptions of reality as expressed by Deleuze/De Landa, Serres/Deutsch?

Every syndiffeonic relation displays two forms of containment: **topological & descriptive***
