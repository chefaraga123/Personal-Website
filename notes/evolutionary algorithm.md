- using a computer simulation you can run many trails, each with a slight random variation the first program 
- An evolutionary algorithm subjects a simulated agent to a battery of tests. 
- At the end of each test run, the program that performed best is retained at the reset a re discarded 
- Then many variants of that program are generated and simulated
- This is evolution in the sense that *variance* and *selection* occurs - but is it evolution in the sense of the creation of *knowledge* by variation and selection 
- **is knowledge created through the execution of the program, or the development of the program by the developer?**
- Biological evolution often reaches a local maxima of fitness
