- [[Git BASH]]
- A distributed version control system, created to support development of the Linux Kernel 
- Core aspects include 
	- **Branching** and **Merging** 
	- **Staging** 
- Using Github 
	- Creating a repository 
- Linking a local repository to GitHub
	- `git remote add origin [repository URL]`
- Pushing code to GitHub
	- `git push -u origin master`
- Push the local master branch to the remote repositor, set the default upstream for the master branch 
	- `git push --set-upstream origin master`
- Creating a new branch
	- `git branch <branch name>`
- Check current branch
	- `git status` or `git branch`
- Add changes in the working directory to the staging area
	- `git add .`
- Save your staged changes + add a descriptive message 
	- `git commit -m "<descriptive message>"`
- Pushing updates to Github pages
	- ````npm run deploy?

- Git can be used to support a [[Continuous Integration, Continuous Deployment (CI,CD)]] pipeline, the process is as follows:
	- Push code changes to a Git repository
	- A CI/CD tool is triggered by the push event 
	- The CI/CD tool runs a pipeline as its defined in the repository 
	- The pipeline runs through various jobs & stages (build, test, deploy)
- **On GitHub:** 
	- GitHub Actions (for GitHub repositories)
	- Define the pipeline in `.github/workflows/workflow.yml`, this defines 
		- Build Steps
		- Test Steps
		- Deploy Steps 
	- Configure Build Environment
	- Integrate with Git
	- Test the pipeline
	- Set Up Deployment
