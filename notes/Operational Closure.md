- tag: [[Information theory as a theory of difference]]
- In systems theory there is the distinction between system and its environment. This distinction is the difference that constitutes a system. But the question that immediately arises - who draws this distinction?
- Crucially: The distinction between system and environment is produced by the system itself. 
- **Systems draw their own boundaries by means of its own operations** 
- A living being does this by living, a social system creates the distinction between system and environment through the occurrence of communication - i.e. by establishing relations between independent living beinds 
- Operations, from beginning to end are only possible inside the system. 
- **The thesis of operational closure** states that systems are operationally closed. They rely entirely on internal operations. Luhmann distinguishes this from [[closed systems]] & the accompanying issue of entropy. 
	*We must now distinguish between operation and causality.... operations must be characterised in a way that also determines the type of system we are talking about in each case. This has nothing to do with causality.... causality is a theory that concerns the observer
	 causality is a judgement, the observation of an observer, a coupling of causes and  effect... Causality is a selective proposition: one is interested in certain causes because one is uncertain about the effects. Or else one would like to achieve certain effects and therefore one poses the question backwards from this endpoint and looks for the causes that makes them possible 
	 Causality is always selective and can therefore always be assigned to an observer with specific interests
	 We must observe the observer if we want to know which kind of causality is ascribed in a certain case and which effects and causes are bought into attributive connection, 
	 **[[closed systems]] were conceived as causally closed**
