- A system of arithmetic for integers where numbers "wrap around" after they reach a certain value, known as the **modulus** 

- **Properties of modular arithmetic**: 
	- **Closure**: The sum, difference, or product of any two integers modulo n is also an integer modulo n. 
	- **Associativity**: Addition and multiplication of integers modulo n are associative  
	- **Commutativity**: Addition and multiplication of integers modulo n are commutative 
	- **Distributivity**: Multiplication is distributive over addition modulo n
