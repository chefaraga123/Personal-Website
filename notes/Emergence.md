- The nature of  [[Temperature]] and [[Pressure]] lead one to think it may be simply reducible to kinetic energy and momentum respective. 
- Emergent properties make possible the decomposition of reality. 
- If scientists had to build models that captured all scales simultaneously no scientific field could successfully explain anything. We would be trapped in a block universe in which every aspect is inextricably tied to every other aspect
- There is a class of high-level phenomena that can be well explained in terms of each other alone, with no reference to anything at the atomic level or below. 
- The behaviour of the whole-class of higher-level phenomena is quasi-autonomous/self-contained - emergence
- The behaviour of high-level physical quantities consists of nothing but the behaviour of their low-level constituents with the details broadly ignored. 
- This has given rise to [[reductionism]], a misconception about emergence & explanation.
