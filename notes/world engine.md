- a sharded rollup framework for running FOCG
- What kind of rollup is needed for FOCGs?
	- **High throughput & TPS**: faster transaction processing, low latency
	- **Extended reads & writes**: Most [[Layer2s]] are designed to do a lot of writes for high concurrency processing, but the game reads to get the player's position, so reads are as important as writes.  
	- Horizontal Scalability chain
	- Flexibility and customisation 
- **Segmented Architecture** 
- Early MMOs, wished to support a large number of players interacting with relatively limited server & network technology
- A solution was [[sharding]] 
- Key components
	- the [[EVM Base Shard]] and a 
	- [[Game Shard]]
