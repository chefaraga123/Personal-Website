- To extend slightly, "**Evolution by natural selection**"
- Motivated to explain structure variety: which in the biology means the variety of species. 
- More generally how does the variety of types come about on the basis of a simple one-time invention of evolution - the biochemistry of life & communication 
- The theory explains how environmental stimuli effect systems which hence change their structure. 
	- How does an event that was merely contingent to begin with generate structural change 
- The Darwinian distinction between variation, selection (structural change) and stabilisation/restabilisation rests on a theory of [[open systems]]
- The theory of evolution showed that plants & animals weren't manifestations of eternal essences but incremental historical constructions, slow accumulations of adaptive traits cemented via [[reproductive isolation]]
