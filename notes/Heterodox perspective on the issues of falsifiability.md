Can we please move past Popper's stupid principle that the ultimate test of the scientificality of a theory is its [[falsifiability]]? And what the fuck does that even mean? For in order to "falsify" a theory you need another theory,
And in order for _that_ theory to be "scientific", according to Popper's stupid principle, it will of course need to be "falsifiable" too, by yet another equally falsifiable theory, and so on _ad infinitum_. And what about the theory of the falsifiability principle itself? Or is that unfalsifiable, and therefore unscientific, according to itself?
